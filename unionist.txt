Seating of Black Students at the Congregational Church	The Unionist	Canterbury Female Academy; Religion; African-American Students	"<p><em>From the (Brooklyn) Unionist, August 29</em></p>
<p>
  The last Advertiser declares that the story of the exclusion of Miss
  Crandall’s scholars from the meeting house “is wholly false.” We expressed
  surprise at a declaration so unqualified, and whether we had not some cause to
  do so, we leave our readers to decide, after they have read the following
  correspondence and the statement subjoined to it.
</p>
<p>
  We say nothing of the feelings which must have dictated such a course, except
  that we envy not their possessor. We wish merely to put on&nbsp; record the
  simple fact, that Miss Crandall’s pupils cannot attend public worship on the
  sabbath, in the only church within three miles of Miss C’s residence, without
  being called in question for so doing,—nay more—that they are virtually
  excluded from that place of worship, though some of them it is said are
  members of the church which regularly assembles there for public worship. And
  this is a land professedly Christian, in a State which boasts of its
  benevolent efforts to diffuse the blessings of the gospel among the distant
  heathen.”

<p>
  When the committee visited you last February, stating their objections to your
  school, they understood from you, by your voluntary suggestion, that you
  should never desire, and never would put your coloured scholars into the
  meeting house — that you could have preaching at your own house, either black
  or white, and you also added, that the citizens of Canterbury need have no
  anxiety on that account, they might be assured, no such request would ever be
  made.
</p>
<p>
  It appears now, that you have departed from this voluntary declaration and put
  your colored scholars into pews ever occupied by the white females of the
  parish. We ask you to inform us soon, by whose license, you have thus taken
  possession of that part of the meeting house.&nbsp; Canterbury July 26th 1833

</p>
<p>TO SOLOMON PAYNE, ANDREW HARRIS, and ISAAC KNIGHT,</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Gentlemen—I received a letter from you on the 27
  <sup>th</sup>
  in which you asked me to inform you soon by whose licence I have taken
  possession of that part of the meeting house that was occupied by my colored
  scholars on the sabbath previous.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I can inform you that the authority, whether lawful or unlawful,
  by which I permitted my family to enter the gallery of your church, was
  permission received from two of the Society’s committee, viz. Dr. Harris and
  Deacon Bacon.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday the 6
  <sup>th</sup>
  of this month I sent a verbal request by Samuel L. Hough to the gentlemen whom
  I address, asking your permission to attend Divine worship with you on the
  sabbath. I asked Captain Hough to inform you that I would purchase seats
  sufficient for my scholars if agreeable to you, if not, any part or portion of
  the meeting house you might see fit for us to occupy, would be acceptable. Of
  this Mr. Hough said he informed you. Dr. Harris, in answer, said we might
  occupy the seat in the gallery appropriated to colored persons. Mr. Hough then
  remarked that the seat would not be sufficient for the scholars—Deacon Bacon
  then replied, that we might take the next pews until we had enough to be
  seated.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Truly I said to the Committee that visited me in February
  last—The scholars who come here shall not trouble you on the Sabbath, for we
  can have preaching, either by colored or white ministers in our own house. The
  committee made me no reply at the time if I am not mistaken, and I think I am
  not.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Upon mature consideration (as regular preaching here was not very
  readily obtained) I considered that I had done entirely wrong in depriving my
  scholars of the privilege of attending religious worship in this village.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; These are my reasons for asking the privilege of entering your
  church; and all the licence I have received is as given above.

<p>P. CRANDALL.</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after the above answer was sent by Miss Crandall to the
  foregoing communication, she received a verbal message, by Samuel L. Hough, Esq. from
  SOLOMON PAYNE, Esq. directing her not to go into the meeting house again with
  her pupils. For the truth of this last statement we rely upon the declaration
  of Samuel L. Hough, Esq.

"		Church attendance, and church membership, were valorized cultural norms. Church seating was institutionalized as a marker of white supremacy, with African-Americans most often being limited to seats in the balcony. In fact, this very issue had led to the walkout by Black leaders Richard Allen and Absalom Jones from St. George's Methodist Church in Philadelphia that launched the [northern Black independent chuch movement] (http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai/community/text3/allenmethodism.pdf).  Therefore this particular battle in Canterbury carried great emotional and strategic weight. For those reading about this controversy in the press - including <em>The Unionist</em> - the idea of denying the students access to attending church created an informal litmus test: spiritual equality before God (favoring the students) or preserving caste privilege in the key social institution that was the Congregational Church in Connecticut.

Formation of the Plainfield Anti-Slavery Society	The Unionist	Abolitionist Organizing; Burleigh Family	"<p>
  “The Unionist of August 29, gives an account of a meeting in Plainfield, Ct.
  at which the <em>‘Anti-Slavery Society of Plainfield, and its vicinity,’</em>
  was organized. An address was delivered by Mr. Andrew Rockwell, and a

Vigilante Attack on Canterbury Female Academy	The Unionist	Canterbury Female Academy; Religion; African-American Students	"<p>BROOKLYN, Ct. October 3.</p>
<p>
  On the evening of Friday Sept. 20th while Miss Crandall and her pupils were
  assembled in the school room for the purpose of holding a religious meeting,
  Rev. Mr. Potter of Pawtucket, R. I. having accepted her invitation to preach
  to them, near the close of the services a clamorous rabble, without, assailed
  the house, a volley of rotten eggs and other missiles were thrown at the
  window, breaking the glass and lodging part of the filth on the curtain. The
  pupils, regardless of the assault, commenced singing the hymn which had just
  been read and went through without interruption.
</p>
<p>
  On Thursday last [Sept. 26th] Miss C. was again brought before Esquire Adams
  for examination on two separate complaints, one for instructing and the other
  for boarding and harbouring {sic} colored persons from abroad. She was bound
  over to the Supreme Court which commenced its session in the place on Tuesday

<p>At no time more than at the present, has been felt the want, in this county, of a firm, independent press. The acts of our last legislature are a sufficient index of the character of that party which has obtained, for a brief space we hope, the ascendancy in this State. We cannot, for a moment, believe that a majority of the people of Connecticut, approve <em>all</em> the recent enactments of our Legislature, but such has been and is still the course pursued by the only press existing in this county, that many of the people are probably unapprised of the spirit and tendency of their proceedings. It is too evident to be denied, that the Advertiser is so devoted to the policy of a party, and the aggrandizement of a few party leaders, that a fair discussion of the pretensions and measures of our prominent men, cannot find admission to its columns. Hence the necessity of another organ of communication to the public, on the great interests of the state and nation, which has brought the Unionist before the public.</p>
<p>This paper will be pledged to no party, but will canvass the claims of all aspirants to the public favor, and all measures of public policy, on their own merits. On all the great questions upon which the mind of the community is divided, a free admission will be given to well and candidly written articles on both sides, if offered, but every thing of a scurrilous or abusive character will be excluded, come from what source it may.</p>
<p>The Unionist will be the advocate of temperance, virtue and sound morality, and will pursue that course which a deep conviction of the truth of the sentiment contained in its motto points out. It will also contain items of general intelligence, literary selections and the usual variety of miscellaneous matter, and no effort will be spared on the part of the editor to make it worthy of the public favor. How far his efforts will succeed, the future course of the paper will determine.</p>

Extract. From a Fourth of July Address	The Unionist	Anti-Slavery	"<p align=""center"">EXTRACT.</p>
<p align=""center""><em>From a </em>4<em><sup>th</sup></em><em> of July address.</em></p>
<p>What, let us consider, was the specific object of our Fathers’ labors and their sacrifices? It was, that they might secure to their posterity, if not to themselves, the rights of man, the blessings of civil and religious liberty, the prerogative of self-government. Who, when he reflects that this was their object, and how steadily they kept it in view, can hesitate to accord to them a higher praise, than is due to the founders of any other nation? It was, let us repeat, the moral character of the American Revolution, which gave it its peculiar grandeur. Do you feel any veneration, any love for Washington and his com-patriots, merely on account of the bloody battles they fought? You ought not. You should recoil with horror from scenes of blood, let the actors in them have been who they may. The heroes of our Revolution, it is true, fought bravely, desperately. But this alone would be equivocal applause. It was the purity of their intentions, their self-devotion to the cause of Liberty, which makes them deservedly the pride of our country, and the honor of our race. The battles which they fought, the thousands of fellow-beings whom they slew, were incidents in the prosecution of their undertaking, which the benevolent can never think of, but with sorrow and loathing.</p>
<p>It is then, we say again, the great moral purpose of the Revolution, which commends it, and those who conducted it, to our most grateful remembrance. How ardent and unfeigned they were in their love of Liberty, is evident not more in what they did and suffered during the contest, than in the provisions they afterwards made for the protection of our rights.— Ere they had laid aside their arms, all fresh from the scenes of danger and of loss through which they had passed, our fathers instituted a form of government, which excluded themselves no less than it excluded others from all distinctions of honor or profit, but such as their fellow citizens might freely accord to them. The principles on which they based our civil fabric are broad and deep. Their recognition of these as the only just foundation of human governments, gives us the clearest evidence that they were men of high intellectual power, and of unparalleled integrity. They promulgated doctrines, the truth and value of which are not yet fully realized. Hereafter, their wisdom and foresight will be more justly, that is to say, more highly appreciated. — Certain momentous questions are now agitating our Republic, and others are soon coming up to trouble us, which might at once be settled by a candid appeal to the constitution which they bequeathed us. —If we guide our political and religious affairs by the plain principles therein propounded, we shall avert those evils, which now threaten our very existence as a united people. But if we disregard them, the most fearful consequences are inevitable.</p>
<p>Our fathers declared that all men are created equal, with a right to freedom — A declaration of infinite import! A glorious, gospel, heaven inspired truth! If we deeply feel and duly regard this, whose rights or feelings shall we violate? This is a truth which ought to be indelibly engraven on every heart. It should control all the measures of government, and the deportment of individuals towards each other. It is <em>the</em> truth, out of which arise those principles, that should guide the intercourse of man with man, and of one community with another, both in respect to their civil and their religious concerns. It is but a new version of our Saviour’s golden rule.</p>
<p>By the result of those measures, which were determined upon fifty-seven years ago, we have been called unto liberty. Let us seriously reflect upon the nature and extent of the blessing, that we may not use it for an occasion to the flesh, but in willing obedience to God and his Christ, whose service alone is perfect freedom.</p>
<p>Think not, brethren, that ye are free because your fathers threw off the yoke of colonial subjection. Think not that ye are free because ye have no king, nor hereditary nobility to reign over you. Think not that ye are free because ye live in a country where the supreme power is in the hands of the people. Such are indeed the highly favorable circumstances of your condition; and yet you may be in bondage, more abject than that from which our fathers were delivered. You may be in bondage to the majority, whose will, if the principles of our constitution be forgotten, may become as absolute and arbitrary as the will of any despot. You may be the creatures of your own party or sect, to whose opinions you may be compelled to assent, and in whose projects you may be obliged to toil, on pain of expulsion from their ranks, and the odium of an outcast. Or worse than all, you may be the slaves of some prevailing vice, or of some wicked or foolish custom.</p>
<p>It was obviously the intention of those who framed our constitution, to sustain every man in forming his own opinions on all subjects, and in acting in accordance with his own opinions, unless they would lead him to violate the equal rights of another. But there are indications every where, that this wise intention of our fathers has already come to be often disregarded. Unmindful of their high individual responsibility, the mass of our people, instead of examining and judging for themselves, seem willing that others should shape their opinions and guide their actions. Though they loudly boast of their freedom, they are the humble servants of “the few.” In consequence, they have become arrayed in parties and sects, the country over, with their general and subordinate leaders, and their organs of inter-communication. What their leaders declare to them, they believe too often, it is feared, without inquiry. Whithersoever their leaders go, they follow, nothing doubting. This is, we believe, too just an account of our religious and political affairs. It is rarely, very rarely, that we see an individual thinking and acting without an undue defence to some party. — How continually do we perceive in large bodies of men, a sameness of opinion and a unity of action, which there could not, would not be, if it were not for some <em>master</em> minds controlling them with absolute authority. Ye have witnessed the struggles of the rival factions in our land. Have ye thought their zeal has been according to knowledge? Have ye seen reason to believe that the individuals, on either side, thoroughly understood the merits of their cause? And that each one acted as his own best judgment and kind feelings dictated? Has it not rather been apparent to you that the individual merged himself in his party, feeling it safe for him to act in concert with numbers; and fearing, that if he should dare to stand alone, withholding himself from both sides, he might be considered trust-worthy by neither, and perhaps would incur some more distinct expression of their displeasure? Do we then exercise and enjoy, as we might and ought to do, that civil and religious liberty of which we are so boastful?</p>
<p>These are a few of many questions, which should be pressed upon the serious consideration of every one. Our limits forbid us to mention several others, which have been suggested to our minds by the return of this season. We wish to see the anniversary of our independence devoted to higher purposes, than it has usually been. There has been enough, and more than enough of self-gratulation. We have taken too much credit to ourselves for the deeds of our fathers. Let us do them and ourselves a higher honor. Let us emulate their excellences and shun their errors.—Indeed let us not be satisfied until we surpass them in knowledge and in virtue; as the superior advantages they procured for us should enable us to do. Let us make a wider and a higher application, than they did, of the great principles for which they so nobly contended. Let us not rest satisfied with our liberty, while aught of slavery abides in our land.</p>"	Authorship unclear	While no author is given, this might well be Samuel J. May's contribution. It embraces peace principles, anti-slavery, and equality before the law. Note that this author feels that the Constitution could resolve the problem of slavery, a position that would later be denounced by Garrisonians.	George Washington
The Spirit of Reform	The Unionist	Allied Reform Movements - general	"<p align=""center"">THE SPIRIT OF REFORM.</p>
<p>What is the spirit of reform? What is it that has animated and enabled men from time to time to become reformers, not disturbers, but true reformers; and not religious reformers alone, but moral reformers of all descriptions? Has it not been a sense of independence and personal responsibleness, and of superiority to what are usually termed existing circumstances and the spirit of the age?</p>
<p>A very large proportion of the evil which has always existed in society, may be traced to the want of personal independence, and disregard of personal responsibility. We do not mean by independence that fiery essence of pride and selfishness, which is quick to resent a slight or wrong; which is always ready to meet aggression more than half way; and which delights to show itself in rudeness or haughtiness, as its condition may happen to be low or high. For such independence we have little sympathy and less respect, and so far from thinking that there is a want of it in the world, can only lament that there is such a superfluity. By independence we mean another and a far different thing.—We mean the resolution which adopts, and maintains, and obeys its own standard of right and wrong; which refuses to render an unquestioning homage to the voice of the many; which, being based upon principle, is not to be driven to and fro by the popular breath, even should that breath rise into a whirlwind; which acknowledging allegiance to a higher than any mortal authority, will not forfeit it at the behest of any. This is the independence which leaves to a man his own views and convictions, his own conscience, and his own conduct. Without inciting or suffering him to be forward or boisterous, it makes him steadfast and sure. Without obliging him to feel an uncharitable scorn of public opinion, it offers a rule to his admiration and observance which is alone worthy of serious study, and entitled to his faithful submission,—the great rule of right, the solemn law of God. It teaches him to consider himself as responsible for his thoughts and actions, in the first and highest place, not to the multitude, but to his Maker; and in the second place, not to the multitude, but to his own soul. It leads him into a safer, happier, and more glorious path, than the broad, dusty, soiled and soiling road, which is beaten by the multitudinous and crowding world. It sets his feet and his heart at liberty, and breathes into his soul the consciousness of individual existence and value, and the sense of individual duty.</p>
<p>This is the independence, to the want of which may be traced and referred very much of past and existing evil. Not possessing it, men lose themselves, their accountability, their dignity, all that constitutes them men, in the absorbing mass; where they acquire the color, and motions, and tendencies of the mighty vortex which has engulphed them. Instead of uttering a voice of their own, they wait for an acclamation, and then they join in; instead of having opinions of their own, they listen for the prevalent opinions, and then they repeat them; instead of having a morality of their own, a religion of their own, they are content to be just as moral and just as immoral, just as religious and just as irreligious, as other people; taking the tone of the world around them, which is seldom the highest, and imbibing its sentiments, which are not always the purest. They do not test and try opinions by any self-instituted process. They do not examine manners and actions according to a fixed and exalted standard. They trouble themselves with nothing of the kind. They fall in with the great procession, without inquiring whither it is going, upwards or downwards, to a good end or a bad one; it is enough for them that they are going with it. Thus it comes that so many think evil is metamorphosed into good, when they see the multitude practise it, and good is turned into evil, when they see the multitude slight, or forsake, or forbid it. And thus it comes, that the amount of evil is so vastly increased, because there are so many who blindly and carelessly, or cowardly, without using their own eyes to observe, or their own minds to prove, follow the multitude to do it.</p>
<p>But must we be singular? Must we be eccentric? Must we do nothing that others do; say nothing that others say?—Must we be perpetually quarrelling with society about its usages and habits? No. We are to do none of these things. It is best that we should follow the many in all ways which are indifferent; perhaps it is best that we should follow them in some ways which are inconvenient; but we must not follow them to do evil. “Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.” That is the simple commandment. It is very true that singularity and eccentricity, when they come from a causeless, wilful, diseased principle of opposition to general custom and sentiment, are no virtues; but even then they partake no more of the nature of sin, than does a servile acquiescence in general custom and sentiment.—Without doubt, public opinion, on most points, is worthy of respectful attention and examination; but, after you have examined it by the great and permanent light within, after you have weighed it in the balance of truth and the gospel, and found it false and wanting, reject and oppose it, and if your decision is to be called singularity and eccentricity, let it be called so, and, in the name of all that is true and holy, be singular and eccentric. We are not required to dispute with the world step by step; we are not required to be solitary and to forsake the world; we are rather called upon to do all the good we can in it, and receive all the good we can from it. But we are required to recognize a higher authority than the world’s will; to obey a more sacred commandment than the world’s law. We are required to form moral and religious principles of our own, and to regulate our commerce with the world. If we will not do this, we shall do evil; for we shall do whatever the multitude does, and the multitude often does evil. The reason why so many follow a multitude to do evil, is, that they want moral independence, and do not hold themselves individually accountable to their own spirit, or to the Father of Spirits.</p>"	Authorship unclear	This editorial extols those who live by steadfast principles, rather than ego, conceit, self-interest, or the whims of popular opinion. Thus it obviously addresses, even if obliquely, the situation of the cognitive minority of Immediate Abolitionists. No author is credited; it is interesting to consider if this might be by Charles Burleigh himself.
Popular Education, Politically Considered	The Unionist	Allied Reform Movements - education	"<p align=""center"">POPULAR EDUCATION,</p>
<p align=""center"">POLITICALLY CONSIDERED.</p>
<p>Allowing what we are so continually boasting about, that more information is universally diffused among us than among any people on earth, and that all are at liberty to acquire knowledge to any extent, still it cannot be denied, that there is prevalent a great deal of ignorance on many subjects of paramount importance. It is nothing to the purpose—it is no consolation whatever to insist, that still we are superior in this respect to other communities. The only question for us to consider is—whether the people of this country have as much knowledge, as is indispensable to their temporal and eternal well-being—their social or individual happiness? Whether there is no need of earnestly reiterating every where among then the exhortation of the wise man “get wisdom, get understanding?”</p>
<p>I am well aware that much is <em>said</em> about the necessity of a general diffusion of knowledge to the preservation of our political constitution. But in respect to this point alone, I question if there be common among us a clear perception, and deep feeling of its importance. Else why is it that in many of our States scarcely any provision, and in some none whatever, is made for the instruction of youth; and that even in those States, which have long been applauded for the great number of their schools, a large proportion of these have ever been and still are inadequate to the purpose for which they were instituted. Though we have in New England much of the form of public education, the reality is generally wanting. Very few, in comparison with the whole number of those who attend our common schools, very few leave them possessed of those elements of good learning, which it is pretended are taught there. Very few indeed who can write their thoughts on any subject with propriety and ease; and not many more who can read the thoughts of others with facility and pleasure. Most that is really acquired at these schools, even by those who make the best use of the advantages afforded in them, is a sort of verbal acquaintance with three or four elementary sciences. They do not acquire there the use of the higher powers of mind—thinking, reasoning, judging—and our youth, excepting in the few instances of those who receive good instruction at home, go forth into the world, mingle in the collisions, and assume more or fewer of the offices of society without knowing how to distinguish between many things that differ essentially. They at once fall into the ranks of this party or that, and are content to swell the number of those, who cry out for one popular leader or another—for this system of measures or that.</p>
<p>Although we often hear it said, an every body concurs in the sentiment, that a federal republic cannot long be maintained unless the people generally are well informed, yet I ask what school, yes what single school can be named, where the great principles of civil government are taught, and the peculiar characteristics of our Federal constitution. These, like all other great principles, are simple, and not hard to be understood, unless, the mind has been warped by a regard to sectional interests, or the schemes of a faction.—What young man of common sense might not easily be made, even before he leaves school, to understand these things perfectly? And if all young men were, as they should be, thus taught, moreover made to realize deeply their individual responsibilities as freemen, how difficult would it be to make them the creatures of a party, and to impose upon them as is continually done by factious men. But instead of this, how true it is, and sad as it is true, that most of our young men are left to learn all they are to know of political science, and of their own duties as members of a great Republic, amidst the contests of rival factions, and from those whose opinions have been warped by sectional interests and party passions.</p>
<p>Let it not be said, that I would impose upon the private citizen a degree of knowledge, which it can be needful only for pubic functionaries, or men of great influence in the community to possess. Let it not be objected, that I am urging the example even of a king upon every one, who hears me. Let it not be urged, that Solomon had a need of great wisdom which any of us have not; and that it is not worthwhile for all our young men to seek knowledge with as much ardor as he did, because only a few can rise to places of important trust. I say let not such sentiments be uttered, especially in this country. For is not the doctrine of hereditary right to rank utterly denounced among us? Are we not <em>all</em> born kings and princes as much as any one? Does not the supreme power emanate from ourselves? Are not <em>the people</em> the sovereign of the land?—Whom they will, they set up, and whom they will, they put down. And surely no one can foretell, which of our youth will hereafter be chosen by their fellow citizens to offices, the duties of which nothing less than the wisdom and understanding of Solomon would qualify them to discharge well.</p>
<p>As every man in the course of events may be called upon to serve the public, every man should qualify himself to do so in the best manner possible. But suppose that ninety out of a hundred of our youth may never be placed in office, be it remembered they are all to take a part in conferring offices; and this, though unhappily it is lightly esteemed, is a duty no less than a privilege of greatest moment. He is not fit to be a freeman, who does not hold his right of suffrage most sacred; too sacred to be prostituted to a party, not less than to the will of an individual usurper! He is not fit to have the right of suffrage, who does not hold his high prerogative in such esteem, that he will not exercise it but upon independent and rational conviction! And such a conviction cannot be formed in a mind that is unenlightened. Can any one deny that the more wisdom an individual may have, the more valuable he will be to the country, though he may never be known in public life?—If all our private citizens were as wise as Solomon, would it not be all the better for themselves and for the nation? Surely so! else are the fundamental principles of our civil constitution false!!</p>"	Authorship unclear	The authorship is not given, so perhaps it is written by Charles C.

"The Advertiser has taken us to task"	The Unionist	Journalistic Debate	"<p align=""center"">THE UNIONIST.</p>
<p align=""center"">BROOKLYN, AUGUST 8, 1833.</p>
<p>The Advertiser has taken us to task quite severely, for what, with his moral accuracy, he calls our “false pretences” or “gross inconsistency.” The irresistible reasoning, by which he arrives at a conclusion so unfavorable to us, deserves a passing notice. After quoting from our prospectus, a sentence showing our disapprobation of the dominant party in our last Legislature, he goes on with the confident air of a man who thinks he cannot be mistaken, “what is this but an acknowledged preference for, and a devotion to a political party?” How conclusive! Because we disapprove one political party, we must necessarily—not merely approve, but be <em>devoted</em> to another. Because we have expressed a hope that one party will not reign long, “it follows” that we shall endeavor to transfer the rule to another. Admirable logic!</p>
<p>To the Advertiser’s assertion that the paper originated in party feeling and from unworthy motives, we answer, (first asking by the way, who probably knows our motives best, we or the Advertiser,) that it matters little to what motives the establishment of the Unionist is attributable, so long as its <em>course</em> is fair, upright and consistent with its professions. If the Advertiser will pursue such a course, we will promise to say nothing about the motives which induced its change from the “bitter hostility to President Jackson and his friends” which it manifested “for nearly five years,” to a course and character diametrically opposite. We will not even hint that the <em>disinterested</em> Advertiser which resolves to “continue firm and unflinching in the pursuance of its duty, so long as it has one reader left,” was <em>bought up</em> by the Jackson party.</p>
<p>But it is said that we are not consistent with our professions. We will not take it upon us to say whether, in making this charge, the Advertiser man has exposed his incapacity to comprehend the plain import of language, or has shown a disposition, wilfully to pervert the truth. One of the two is evident. That we do not possess experience “in getting up independent papers,” headed with professions at variance with our intended practice, or in any other species of deception, which would enable us to impose upon the public and yet escape suspicion, we freely confess; nor is it our desire at present to avail ourselves of the superior experience in such matters of any of our editorial brethren. When we engage in an enterprise which requires that kind of experience, we shall doubtless call in the assistance of such of our acquaintance as are best versed in the mystery of making promises to be “revoked.” But that we are incompetent to the easy task of telling the truth, (for we consider it easy, whatever the Advertiser may think of it,) in plain, intelligible language, we are unwilling yet to admit. We refer any candid man, to our prospectus, and the leading article of our first number, for evidence that we have spoken intelligibly; and to the whole of that sheet, and of this also, for proof that, so far as we can be judged by our acts, what we said was <em>truth</em> that we have been consistent with our professions. We ask our readers to compare with the evidence thus collected, the leading article and several other pieces in the last Advertiser, and say if that paper has not misrepresented us. We have never represented ourselves as indifferent or neutral on the questions moral or political, at present agitating the community, nor are we so. We have opinions which we shall defend to the extent of our poor ability, for their defence this paper was established. In our leading article last week, we alluded to the fact that “the majority had no organ of communication,” as one reason why some gentlemen opposed in sentiment to the Advertiser, had put in operation this press, one object of which would be, to counteract the effect of the Advertiser’s unfair course. Now does not this show clearly, that in charging us as guilty of inconsistency because we oppose the measures he advocates, the Advertiser editor brings against us a groundless accusation.</p>
<p>But it will perhaps be said, we are pledged to no party. And so we are. Can the Advertiser see no difference between opposing his party and supporting another? Cannot this paper be made the organ of the majority, and yet be the exclusive organ of no party? If he will lay his finger on the passage in our paper in which we advocate any party as such, or in any way depart from our expressed design of canvassing the claims of men and the propriety of measures on their own merits, then will we acknowledge our offence, and humbly ask forgiveness and promise amendment, nor will we “revoke our promise” before the week’s end, even should he tell his readers we have made it.</p>
<p>While we thus openly declare that we are not indifferent on the subjects which have been noticed in our paper, we still adhere to our avowal, that we shall discuss them and give our opinions upon them, without reference to the circumstances that this or that party holds sentiments similar to, or differing from ours, we shall also admit properly written communications against, as well as in favor of our views. If this will not constitute our paper as independent one, we acknowledge our ignorance of the meaning of the term.</p>
<p>When the Advertiser detects us departing from this course, he may then complain of us, as we have done of him, for being one sided, and may call ours a “counterfeit independent paper.” And when we perceive him pursuing a course like this, we will acknowledge his right to the praise of <em>genuine</em> independence. But till then we shall consider ourselves justified in adhering to our original assertion, that the <em>want of fairness and independence </em>in the Advertiser, led to the establishment at this time, of another paper.</p>"		There would be much in the way of partisan posturing between Charles C. Burleigh and the editors of the local newspapers that opposed the Canterbury Female Academy. He is forthright here, and reinforces that The Unionist is not "indifferent or neutral on the questions moral or political, at present agitating the community," meaning the issues around race, citizenship, women's education, and abolition raised by the Canterbury Female Academy.
"We cannot but admire the facility"	The Unionist	Journalistic Debate	"<p>We cannot but admire the facility with which the Editor of the Advertiser disposes of his promises, which like the poets’ oaths,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Are but words, and words but wind</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too feeble instruments to bind.”</p>
<p>It is not every man that can make a promise Monday, and “revoke” it by the middle of the same week, but that faculty seems to belong in a rather eminent degree to our “courteous” neighbor. Nor is our admiration much less, when we notice his ingenious method of convincing those who, he thinks, doubt the correctness of his assertions. “I have a letter to show,” says the Editor. A “certain person” calls and requests a sight of it. Oh! I have lent it, but you shall see it when it is returned. The “person” relates the transaction just as it occurred, and without note or comment. “You doubt my word” exclaims the Advertiser, “you insinuate that I never had the letter, and now <em>you</em> shan’t see it.” Who can resist the conviction that he certainly had the letter, as he said.—Now we assure the Advertiser man that we have no desire to see the document if he does not wish it. And farther if it will afford him any consolation we will add, that it was never our intention to insinuate that it had not been in his possession, nor do we believe that our plain narrative contains any such insinuation.</p>"		Accusations of dissimulation between Burleigh and James Holbrook, editor of the Windham Advertiser.

"Who pays," asks the Advertiser	The Unionist	Journalistic Debate	“Who pays?” asks the Advertiser. We of course feel deeply sensible of the honor done us by the solicitude our kind neighbor manifests about our affairs, and therefore instead of replying, (in the laconic style in which <em>we</em> should expect to be answered, were we to ask such questions,)—it is none of your business,—we will inform the Advertiser for his especial benefit, that we seriously think of adopting the novel expedient of requiring those to pay, who take the paper. If the people of this county and vicinity choose to support our paper it will go on, if not, then to calm the fears of our self-appointed guardian, we assure him, that we have no intention of continuing it. We are somewhat at a loss to discover how our neighbor is so much better acquainted with our business, than we are, but his assertion that no arrangements have been made to prepare subscribers for this paper, is either a proof that he is so, or another evidence of his happy talent, for manufacturing facts. Had he not given us this information, (which is certainly as new to us as anything contained in his sheet,) we should have firmly believed that we <em>had</em> made “arrangements to procure subscribers,” nay more, that our arrangements had not been wholly ineffectual. But if the Advertiser knows better, why! We must be mistaken, that’s all.		<em>The Unionist</em> received considerable financial backing from the wealthy New York merchant and Abolitionist Arthur Tappan. This connection appeared suspicious to James Holbrook of the <em>Windham Advertiser</em>, who made insinuations against <em>The Unionist</em> as a result. This is Burleigh's reply to these attacks.

We confess having spoken without sufficient reflection	The Unionist	Journalistic Debate	We confess having spoken without sufficient reflection, in saying that the Advertiser is <em>bound by</em> express promises. We now amend; by substituting for that complained of, the assertion that the Advertiser <em>has made</em> an express promise in respect to the course he should pursue. We allude to his promising admission to communications on both sides of the Canterbury question, a promise of which we presume he will not require the “measurement,” since he has, by assigning his reasons for so doing, admitted having made and revoked it. But if he chooses to have it that he has made no express promises to conduct his paper "with that independence and fairness which ought to characterize a public journal," we are willing he should have it so, and if he prefers to set in such a manner as shows that he considers himself under no implied obligation to that fairness, why! Let him so act. But really, we did not expect he would publicly take exceptions to our declaration, that he is bound to conduct with that “fairness which <em>ought to characterize</em> a public journal.”		As is true in today's media environment, the promise to represent "all sides" is often made disingenuously.

We hope the story has gained no more credence than it deserves, for to believe it, would be great injustice to the quiet and orderly people of Brooklyn. We would humbly hope moreover, that our contemplated course is not so displeasing to the people as to excite them to such an action even if they were,—as we are sure they are not—disposed to adopt violent measures to serve their ends. The indications of public favor which we have already perceived, encourage us to believe, that so far from being put down by force, we shall be sustained by the countenance and patronage of a candid (not “credulous”) community.		The fact that Burleigh denies there was an attack on the office vouches for his honesty; he eschews any attempt to gain sympathy by pretending there was an attack.

Letter to the Editor	The Unionist	Constitution	"<p align=""right"">FOR THE UNIONIST.</p>
<p>MR. EDITOR.—It is often said that the perpetuity of our peculiar form of government, and the preservation of our free institutions, which are in truth the chief glory of our land, depend upon the INTELLIGENCE and VIRTUE of the people; this has been so often repeated and so universally assented to, that it has come to be a trite political maxim. Now suppose, or rather admit, the people of Connecticut to be an <em>intelligent people, </em>what will be one of the necessary consequences resulting from the admission? Surely that the people themselves examine the spirit and tendency of all laws which are to be enforced among them; and further that they see and know that their Representatives in the exercise of their delegated power, do not transcend the limits prescribed them by the Constitution, which is a gauge in the hand of the Constituent to be applied to acts of the delegate.</p>
<p>The Constitution was not made for the Executive, nor the Legislative, nor the Judicial department of the Government! For whom then was it made? The people made it, and they made it for themselves and for their posterity; it is then emphatically the people’s; and on its provisions they rely, for its support they will contend, and by its spirit and its letter shall their privileges and immunities be adjudged. It is a mighty shield, which the humblest citizen may lift up between himself and the inflictions of injury by arbitrary, assumed authority; it is a sanctuary, to which the persecuted may flee and find ample and free protection; and it is a Haven, so safe that he who <em>anchors within </em> it, needs no <em>insurance</em>!</p>
<p>Such being the Constitution, how invaluable a treasure! What should be done to preserve it? Diffuse knowledge through the land,—open the fountains of intelligence,—be as Catholic in matters of Education, as you are tolerant in religion,—be in fact, what you are in profession,—a Democracy, and let the INTELLIGENCE be, where the POWER is, in the People! Then, and not till then, will the symmetry of our inimitable form of Government shine forth in the full splendor and beauty of its exact proportions; then, and not till then, will the harsh notes of discord cease, and be succeeded by a deep and national euphony sweeping over the land, and by its magic strains charming to the standard of the Constitution, every lover of his race,—of his Country and of his God. Who that is at all competent to examine with understanding the Constitution of the U. States—to perceive its checks and balances—where power is imparted and where again, it operates with restraining force—where provisions are made for an efficient and energetic administration of the government, and in case of abuse, the <em>Cavesson</em> placed in the hands of the people—to see with a philanthropic ken, the beautiful and harmonious distributions of the functions of Government, among the various departments, and above all to perceive and realize that, with the framers of this revered instrument, the ultimate object, after all was the security and happiness o the people,—who that can do this, will not wish the Constitution of his country to remain inviolate, and be desirous that to the Constitutional test should be brought every doubtful or ambiguous enactment of State Legislatures? Although I detest all petty litigation by which the peace of community is many times disturbed, yet I most heartily rejoice when ever I see one of my fellow citizens on whom a law, novel in its provisions and doubtful in its tendency, is made to bear, pursuing “the peaceful and rightful remedy” by laying his complaint before a tribunal, constituted, among other things, to protect the citizen from all unconstitutional enactments upon his personal liberty, or his right of private property. The citizen who does this evinces a vigilance, and a respect for the great charter of our rights, commendable to himself, and worthy the emulation of others. What will be the prospect of the Republic, when such a deep and sickly apathy shall overtake our citizens, as that they can witness even with partial indifference any infractions upon the Constitution, their richest earthly treasure; and if its integrity be preserved, the best inheritance of their children, but, when crippled and polluted, their sorest calamity!</p>

The Question	The Unionist	Education; Canterbury Female Academy	"<p align=""center"">THE QUESTION.</p>
<p><strong>Considerable pains are taken to keep the question respecting the Canterbury School from coming fairly before the public. The following extract from Mr. May’s letter to Andrew T. Judson, Esq. presents it in the true light.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing, I am confident, could have been further from Miss Crandall’s intention, than to do her neighbors any injury. And Sir, you may rest assured, the gentlemen referred to in her Advertisement would not uphold her a moment in violating any of your rights. The determination she has formed to devote herself to the education of colored females, we cannot but highly approve. Her residence in your village is altogether a providential circumstance. We should encourage her benevolent enterprise, wherever it might be undertaken. And if a suitable situation can be provided for her, in some place where her neighbors would assist and cheer her, or where they would only not molest her, we should rejoice to have her remove thither. But you declared, in the town meeting, that the school should not be located in any part of Canterbury—and also that there is not a town in the State which would admit such a seminary within its borders. It is therefore all the more necessary that she should be sustained where she now is. It is to be deeply regretted that yourself and others are opposed to her. We think you are doing yourselves no honor; and more than that, we are persuaded you are helping to perpetuate the great iniquity, and the deep disgrace of our country. The question between us is not simply whether thirty or forty colored girls shall be well educated at a school to be kept in Canterbury; but whether the people in any part of our land will recognize and generously protect the “inalienable rights of man,” without distinction of color? If this be not done, in Connecticut, where else in our land can we expect it will be done, at least in our day? That it cannot be done even in this State without a struggle, is not most shamefully obvious. A year or two since, some benevolent individuals proposed to erect an institution, at New Haven, for the education of colored young men. The design was defeated by violent opposition. If the citizens had opposed merely its location in that City, they might have escaped condemnation, for such a seminary there might have been very prejudicial to Yale College. But it was only too apparent, that their hostility to the institution was peculiarly embittered by their prejudices against the color of those, who were to be educated at it. So too in the case at Canterbury; no one pretends there would have been any opposition to Miss Crandall’s school, if her pupils were to be white. The tincture of their skin then it is which has called out the men of influence in array against her; and has even procured from the freemen of the town an expression of their “unqualified disapprobation” of her plan.</p>
<p>Here then, in Connecticut, we have had two recent instances of outrage committed upon “the inalienable rights of man.” Among these rights, to use the language of the Declaration of Independence “are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Now Education has from the first, been regarded in this State highly conducive to private happiness, and the public weal. Yet have our colored brethren been twice angrily denied permission to seek this blessing, to the extent they have desired. Will the people of Connecticut generally, countenance these violation of our civil and religious principles? If they will, let them no longer claim to be a republican, much less a christian people!</p>"		Samuel J. May (1797-1871) was the Unitarian minister of Brooklyn - the only Unitarian clergyman in the entire state of Connecticut at the time - and the best strategic thinker among Prudence Crandall's local white allies. Here he names the problem quite precisely: "Education has from the first, been regarded in this State highly conducive to private happiness, and the public weal. Yet have our colored brethren been twice angrily denied permission to seek this blessing." The "twice angrily denied" refers to the New Haven Manual Labor College effort of 1831, while the second denial is the Black Law against the Canterbury Female Academy.	Andrew Judson; Samuel J.

  Rufus Adams, Esq. and have made the following remarks upon it.
</p>
<p>
  We publish to day an article from Canterbury which has appeared in several
  papers of that neighborhood. We do so, because we understand it to be a sort
  of official declaration of the grounds upon which the law and proceedings
  under it, relative to the school for colored children in that town, are to be
  defended. We are certainly willing it should have all proper weight. Yet we
  must think the ground taken will be very difficult to maintain. The opposition
  to the school then, is made because it is a school of immediate abolition
  doctrines. This is not the ground of defence which has ever before been taken.
  The Report to the Legislature and the Law, both set forth the injurious influx
  of blacks from other states as the evil to be prevented. But whether new or
  old, the position now assumed is one which cannot be maintained under our
  institutions. We have learned, and our constitutions are based upon the
  knowledge, that the best way to put down error is by argument, not by law.
  That the best way to maintain truth and sound opinions is to leave error
  unrestrained. Admitting therefore, that the doctrines of the abolitionists are
  never so erroneous, it amounts to nothing in defence of the law; for error,
  whether religious, political, scientific, or of whatever sort, is entitled, so
  far as the laws are concerned, to set up schools and colleges, and propagate
  itself by all peaceable means, as entirely unrestrained as if it were pure
  truth. Surely in Connecticut, that focus of toleration, the doctrines of this
  defence will find no countenance. As to the improprieties in the manner of
  introducing the school, and the abusive anonymous letters which were sent to
  the gentlemen, they are certainly not matters which full grown men should set
  forth in so formidable a manner. Indeed we think that such a defence as this,
  must be with sensible men, their last effort before abandoning the cause.

  Ladies. The citizens of Canterbury readily embraced the offer, and gave her
  their patronage. The School, continued from the Fall of 1831, until January or
  February, 1833. At that time, as we have since learned, Miss C. was proselyted
  to the
  <em>immediate Abolition</em>
  faith. She started for Boston under a fictitious pretence, and saw
  <em>Mr. Garrison,</em>
  the leader of that party. She returned home and immediately went to New York
  and came back, as she told us, with an engagement and under a contract, to
  receive into her school, twenty colored girls, with an expectation of
  increasing the number to the full extent of her accommodations. The dismission
  of her former school, and the announcement of this new project, was the first
  knowledge given to those who had patronized her. It was soon ascertained upon
  what ground the school was to be established, and what principles were to be
  inculcated. The levelling principles of the immediate abolitionists, had taken
  full possession of her mind, and it was soon made known to us,
  <em>who</em>
  were to be the patrons of the school. When we saw Arnold Buffum, and others
  associated with him, assert what they denominated her rights, and when their
  threats were poured out upon the town, and all its inhabitants, we could
  anticipate the ultimate effects upon the town.
</p>
<p>
  We distinctly state to all who may feel an interest in this matter, that we
  are not opposed to the education and kind treatment of the colored people. It
  is not in the power of any man, in truth, to say, that we have ever
  ill-treated a person of color. We desire to see them free and happy. This is
  the universal sentiment of the inhabitants of the town, so far as we know it.
  Our schools admit colored children to equal privileges, and we rejoice that
  they do so. Those schools are all visited and are under the superintendence of
  proper boards, excluding all danger, from the inculcation of erroneous
  principles. The law now in force, makes schools for foreign blacks subject to
  the assent of the civil authority and select men of each town, so that it is
  an easy matter to have such a school now, provided that board could be
  satisfied that no pernicious principles are to be inculcated, and no danger
  could arise to the town or state. Is not this right? Why should any person
  desire to force upon any community, a school of any sort, against all their
  wishes? Have the inhabitants no right to be heard in reference to the location
  of such an institution among them, and more especially when they know the
  dangerous consequences to which such measures would tend? Are the people of
  this State ready to admit that the abolitionists, as they are called, are
  diffusing sentiments and opinions consistent with the constitution and the
  peace of society? Is there any individual in the State of Connecticut, who
  would feel willing to have such a school. Together with all the necessary
  evils, situated within his own town or village? The answer, will be, no. Then
  let the same feeling be extended to us. This is the only way to ascertain
  whether the town of Canterbury has done right or wrong. The distinct objection
  which has been made by the inhabitants of the town, to the location of this
  school within its limits, consists in the dangerous tendency of the principles
  pressed by the abolitionists wherever they go, in language peculiar to
  themselves.—These principles are well understood, and it would be with deep
  regret, that any school should be established and continued, for their
  advancement, in a community where our friends are compelled to reside.*
</p>
<p>
  The manner in which Miss C. effected the change in her school, was very
  objectionable, and no friend that we have met with, can furnish any
  justification. We know of nothing that could have been done by the town, that
  has not been done, to induce her to remove the school, to some place where
  there were no objections. She has been urged by individuals—and entreated by
  committees, who have waited upon her, to give up this location of her school.
  We have heretofore stated, and we now repeat it that we offered to take the
  house at the price she had contracted to pay for it, and relieve her from any
  loss on that account. This was declined, and then the town petitioned the
  General Assembly, and the law which she, with the advice of her friends, now
  resists, was passed. Nearly a month after the rising of the Legislature, she
  was notified that a suit would be commenced by the Grand Juror. At the trial,
  her counsel gave in a demurrer to the complaint, admitting the facts true, and
  submitted to the finding of the court without argument. The Court required her
  to give bonds of $150 to appear at the net Court, which she refused to
  give.—This she had a right to do, and be committed if she chose. No one will
  say that she could not have given the bond on the spot. But it had been agreed
  before hand, by those who directed her what to do, that she should go to jail.
  She went and staid as long as suited her purposes, less than 24 hours, and
  then gave the bond. Some person has put in wide circulation, the story that
  she was confined in the cell of Watkins the murderer. This is part of the same
  contrivance to “get up more excitement!” She never was confined in the
  “murderer’s cell.” She was lodged in the debtor’s room, where every
  accommodation was provided, both for her and
  <em>her friends,</em>
  whose visits were constant. She was confined no where else. It is said in
  justification of this untruth, that Watkins, some of the last days of his
  life, was taken out of his cell to receive the clergy and his friends, in the
  debtor’s room, because it was more convenient. How does that accord with the
  statement made? Just as well might it be said by those who go into the
  meeting-house, where Watkins attended meeting some of his last Sabbaths, that
  <em>they</em>
  had been in the “murderers cell.”
</p>
<p>
  Does any one think or believe that this school, with all its evils, should be
  fixed, and permanently located here, we will just ask them to consider the
  manner too, in which this has been pressed upon us, by foreigners or persons
  residing out of town and State. If they are actuated by the pure principles of
  benevolence, how much more of that virtue they would evince to the world, by
  taking the school home to the places of their own residence. What necessity is
  there to bring persons from New York, or Philadelphia, to Canterbury? They
  certainly can be educated there quite as well, and more especially if we are
  so much like barbarians as is pretended. We wish this to be well considered,
  before blame is cast upon the town of Canterbury. Is not the peace and safety
  of community, of consequence? It will not be understood that the town ever
  entertained any danger from the girls themselves, but every person must know
  that many others will of necessity, be drawn around this nucleus, and
  connected with the principles of the abolitionists, who will not say that our
  habitations, our persons and our peace, will be insecure? In answer to this
  question, we will exhibit to the public, some of the principles,—some of this
  christian benevolence,—some of this milk of human kindness, extended to us.
  During the last week, the
  <em>“Climax”</em>
  has been circulated, and sent us from the Post office in New York, marked with
  double postage, when the gentleman from whose press it issued, might as well
  have brought it himself to us, as to others. We unequivocally say, the
  ”Climax” is a wanton perversion of truth.
</p>
<p>
  We will invite the reader to go one step further. We have received through the
  Post Office, from some zealous abolitionist, a tract, upon which is
  ingeniously written, in connection with the title of the tract, so that when
  taken together it reads as follows—viz:
</p>
<p>“Thus saith the Lord, consider your way.</p>
<p>The Eternal Misery of Hell: this place is for whom?</p>
<p>For Judge Adams and A.T. Judson.”</p>
<p>
  If the reader will not be wearied, one other specimen of this benevolent work,
  which is going on to coerce this State into these Christian measures, as they
  are denominated, shall also be exhibited to public view. On the 18
  <sup>th</sup>
  inst., one of the signers of this communication had delivered to him by the
  Post Master, a letter mailing in Pittsburg, Penn. July 12, in the following
  language:
</p>
<p align=""right"">‘Pittsburg July 10, 1833.</p>
<p>
  “Disgraceful Scoundrel—I have just read in the Boston Advocate, that you have
  had a white young lady put in prison, for taking in her school some colored
  girls. From all that I have seen and heard of your conduct in this matter, I
  must say my opinion of you is this—You is (are) a poor, dirty, mean, pitiful,
  dastardly puppy. Hypocritical villain, a rascal of the lowest order. I cannot
  or will not waste any more paper with such a Hell deserving hypocrite as you
  is. (are.) But this much I will tell you, I will be in Canterbury in 3 weeks,
  and you may prepare yourself for me, for I mean to beat you under the earth,
  if I can lay my hands on you. If not I will take a shot at you. You poor dead
  dog.”
</p>
<p>
  “N.B. If you don't change your course of life and conduct towards that good
  young woman, in case I do not meet with you myself, I will hire some Irishman
  to mould you. It
  <em>shall</em>
  be done if I have to [pay] five hundred dollars to have it done.”
</p>
<p>
  “I leave you a poor Devil. G.P.”
</p>
<p>
  “The name of the young lady is Miss Prudence Crandall. At the advice of a
  friend, [I] erase my name, as I shall be in your little Hell.”
</p>
<p>
  Fellow citizens, such is the temper, and such the means employed, to fasten
  upon this town, and its inhabitants, an institution of
  <em>benevolence.</em>
  When it shall be fastened here, what will be the effect? We leave them to the
  sober judgment of reflecting men.

  *The charge implied in this sentence, is a FALSE ACCUSATION. It is also a

  on the 4
  <sup>th</sup>
  of July last, when it was met with a prompt denial of its truth.
</p>
"		The circular of Judson and Adams is a revealing document. Outraged and petulant in tone, they complain about receiving hate mail, about Crandall's support from out of state, and about the content of the school inculcating Abolitionist ideas. They give away their ultimate position when they ask "Does any one think or believe that this school, <b>with all its evils</b>, should be fixed, and permanently located here(?)"

Samuel J. May's response to Adams and Judson Circular	The Unionist	Abolition; White Opposition	"<p>TO RUFUS ADAMS, ESQ.,</p>
<p>AND ANDREW T. JUDSON, ESQ.</p>
<p>
  Gentlemen: I presume that the foregoing communication contains a statement of
  the case, between yourselves &amp; Miss Crandall, as favorable to yourselves,
  as you were able to make. The request to all the Editors of newspapers in the
  state, that they would republish the article is proof sufficient of the
  estimation in which it is held. Still, gentlemen, it appears to me to be any
  thing but an exculpation of yourselves. This I shall now attempt to show.
</p>
<p>
  You evidently intend it should be believed, that Miss Crandall gave the
  citizens of Canterbury just cause of offence, at first, in having so soon
  discontinued the instruction of their daughters. The charge has indeed been
  explicitly brought against her in another periodical (“the Colonizationist No.
  2”) in a letter from Canterbury, written very probably by one or the other of
  yourselves. It is there stated, that she “made numerous and solemn engagements
  with the citizens of Canterbury, that if they would aid her in the
  establishment of a school, she would continue the school for their children.
  “These engagements” says the letter-writer “she has violated without excuse.”
  If you could prove all this, Gentlemen, you would certainly prove that
  <em>she</em>
  did very wrong, but not that
  <em>you</em>
  have done right.” I will venture to say however, that if she had given up the
  office of an instructress altogether, we never should have heard a
  syllable about her “numerous, solemn engagements.” And discontinued the
  instruction of your children, if she had not first been threatened with the
  loss of your patronage, unless she dismissed from her school a colored girl,
  whom she thought it her duty to educate.† Now, gentlemen, if it be true, as
  you assert, that you and your neighbors are not opposed to the education and
  kind treatment of colored people, if you really desire to see them free and
  happy, why was Miss C. threatened with loss of patronage if she permitted
  Sarah Harris to continue as one of her pupils? You tell your readers that the
  common schools in your town admit colored children to equal privileges with
  white ones, and that you rejoice that they do so. Why then did you not rejoice
  that Miss Crandall admitted a colored girl into her school? Why! unless you
  chose that the children of colored people should enjoy the blessings of
  education, only in a very stinted measure? Answer me this if you please?
</p>
<p>
  Again. You complain, and have elsewhere complained that Miss C. made the
  change in her school abruptly—that she did it without asking the consent or
  even the advice of her former patrons. I apprehend that the blame for
  this must attach to yourselves rather than to her. If you had ever evinced,
  that interest in the education and freedom and happiness of our colored
  brethren, which you now profess to feel, there can be little doubt that she
  would have disclosed to you her feelings and her purposes; and gladly have
  availed herself of your assistance. But she perceived that you, like most of
  our white brethren, regarded the colored children of our Heavenly Father as
  doomed to degradation, and not to be admitted to equal privileges even in this
  land of boasted liberty. Therefore she did not reveal her plan until it was
  matured. She anticipated that you would oppose it. The event has proved that
  she judged correctly.
</p>
<p>
  But you assure your fellow-citizens, and have made the declaration before,
  that the main ground of your opposition to the school, has been and is that
  you know certain erroneous principles were to be inculcated there. What those
  principles are, you have not stated. You
  <em>assert</em>
  that they are very dangerous—thinking perhaps that you may thus frighten the
  community into the belief that your persecution of Miss Crandall has been
  altogether reasonable, and praiseworthy. Have not the enemies of truth, and
  freedom, and the Gospel in all ages pursued a similar course? Let us see how
  you have proceeded.
</p>
<p>
  Miss Crandall advertised in several newspapers, that she would receive into
  her family “young ladies and little misses of color” and give them instruction
  in certain branches of knowledge, which she specified. You and others in the
  village were offended at her proposal. And I venture to say that no one of you
  will deny that the real ground of your offence was, that her pupils were to be
  colored girls. If her proposals had been to receive into her family “young
  ladies and little misses” from New-York and Boston and other cities, whose
  parents would be able and willing to pay more liberally for their education,
  than we in the country are accustomed to pay for ours. I suppose not one of
  her neighbors would have dreamt of denying her the right to do so. It was then
  without doubt the color of her pupils, that was the whole ground of the
  objection made at first to her school. Instead however of frankly
  acknowledging this—acknowledging that you are unbelievers (practically at
  least) of the great truth that all men are created equal, and have an
  unalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness—instead I say
  of frankly acknowledging your unbelief or your dislike of this truth, as the
  ground of your opposition, you have gone about (like the opposers of human
  improvement in all ages) to make it generally believed that the school was
  established for purposes very different from those avowed in the
  advertisement. You have tried to awaken the apprehension that the existence of
  such a school will be directly or indirectly most dangerous to the peace, and
  welfare of the country. And you now set this forth as your principal objection
  to the school.
</p>
<p>
  How should you, gentlemen, like to be dealt with in this mode? How would Col.
  Judson like to find his neighbors opposing his location in their village, on
  the presumption, that he had set up his office there, for other purposes than
  those of his profession—on the presumption that he came there to disseminate
  certain pernicious doctrines in politics or religion? How would he like it, if
  he found the people of Canterbury combined to make him discontinue his
  practice as a lawyer, or leave the town, because he is known to be a
  freemason. If his neighbors should succeed in diffusing unfriendly feelings
  towards him throughout the town, and at length procured a general meeting of
  the inhabitants to express their unqualified disapprobation of his purpose to
  continue as a lawyer among them, what would he think, what would he say, if
  after having heard himself accused of holding and intending to disseminate
  pernicious principles, his fellow citizens should refuse his permission to be
  heard in explanation and defence of his real views and purposes? Would he not
  cry out against the unrighteousness? Gentlemen, you must reverse the case, if
  you would see how your conduct appears to many, and will appear to many more.
</p>
<p>
  That some of Col. Judson’s principles are actually bad, dangerous to the peace
  of Society &amp;c. has now become most notorious. For has he not been laboring
  from the first to prevent the dissemination of what he believes to be
  erroneous and dangerous opinions, not by
  <em>showing</em>
  them to be erroneous, but by exciting the popular prejudices, and calling for
  the interference of the civil arm? And is there any principle, which has
  wrought more mischief in the world that this? All history answers, No.
</p>
<p>
  In this connexion, I will notice a false accusation which you have again
  brought against me. You accuse Mr Buffum and myself of pouring out threats
  upon the town and inhabitants. The same charge you alleged more explicitly
  against us in the Norwich Republican of March 27
  <sup>th</sup>
  . But you have never informed the public what those threats were.—Nor can you.
  None were uttered. I now declare, that I heard not a word from Mr Buffum in
  the tone or spirit of threat; and that not a syllable of the kind escaped my
  lips. I call upon you to contradict me if you please—and make your
  contradiction good if you can.
</p>
<p>
  You have taken no little pains, gentlemen, in your communication, &amp; on
  other occasions, to make it appear as if you and the people of Canterbury are
  the injured, suffering party. That you may have suffered some injury in the
  course of the unhappy collision, which you have awakened, is possibly true.
  But that any injury, any disregard to your rights and feelings was intended in
  the establishment of Miss Crandall’s school on its present plan, there is not
  the slightest reason to suppose. I can most solemnly declare, that from the
  first I have been willing to treat even your prejudices with some
  consideration. Witness my letter to Miss Crandall, dated Feb. 28
  <sup>th</sup>
  , written so soon as I heard of the opposition you were preparing to make to
  the prosecution of her plan. If I had been permitted to speak for her at your
  town meeting, as
  <em>she</em>
  requested I might be permitted to do, you would soon have learnt that neither
  Miss C. nor her patrons had any wish to force the continuance of her school in
  your village. They were, and I trust still are, willing to have it removed to
  any
  <em>suitable</em>
  place, that might be obtained for it. In a conversation with Col. Judson a few
  days after the meeting, I gave him this assurance distinctly; as he doubtless
  remembers. His reply I shall never forget. ‘No,’ said he, ‘that school shall
  not be located in any part of the town of Canterbury; no—not in part of the
  State of Connecticut. I will get a law passed,’ he continue, ‘by our next
  Legislature, prohibiting the introduction of colored from other States into
  this for the purpose of attending school.‡ I can obtain thirty thousand
  signers to a petition for such a Law.’ The same overbearing, tyrannical spirit
  was conspicuous in that gentleman’s language and manner, at the town meeting;
  and has been too apparent in many of his doings since. To protect, if I may be
  able a lone woman from the operations of such a spirit, I have felt it my duty
  to stand with others between her and her oppressors. If she has done wrong, or
  spoken unadvisedly, let her be rebuked. I would not attempt to justify her
  error. But she has rights, and they must be respected. If her location in your
  village is disagreeable to you, and you can enable her to procure suitable
  accommodations elsewhere, I for one should advise her to remove, &amp; I
  believe all her patrons would concur in the advice. But your attempt to compel
  her to abandon her school, we regard as a flagrant violation of her privileges
  as an American citizen, and we have therefore advised her to resist, peaceably
  but firmly. The law which you have procured from our last Legislature, we are
  confident is unconstitutional, and have been so advised by able civilians.—We
  have therefore thought it best for Miss C. to continue her school, until the
  validity of that Law shall have been ascertained. If it shall be found to be
  indeed a good and a valid law of Connecticut, then of course Miss Crandall and
  her patrons will peaceably abide the consequences of her violation of it. Her
  school must be abandoned; and it must then be acknowledged before the world
  “that all men are not permitted to enjoy their unalienable rights even in
  New-England.""
</p>
<p>
  I have more to say in reply to your communication; and shall resume my remarks
  next week; when I shall particularly notice the charge so often repeated by
  you, that false and dangerous principles are to be taught at Miss C’s school.
</p>
<p>SAMUEL J. MAY</p>
<p>
  *To preclude the possibility of an inference that the truth of this accusation
  is admitted, we would simply express our conviction that Miss C. has made no
  engagements, of which the discontinuance, or the change of her school could be
  considered a violation. She went to Canterbury, at least as much to confer a
  favor as to receive one, and was never under any more obligation to teach the
  children of that village, than are the merchants there to sell their goods to
  her or others, nor did she suppose the people of Canterbury to be obligated to
  send their daughters to her school, more than they were, or than she was, to
  purchase the commodities offered by those merchants.
</p>
<p>
  † See Miss Crandall’s Letter published in the Advertiser of May 9
  <sup>th</sup>
  .
</p>
<p>
  ‡ Col. Judson in the earnestness of his determination to overthrow Miss
  Crandall’s school, threatened that there should also be a clause in his Law,
  by which the colored people in the State should be restrained within the towns
  to which they now belong, so that even their children could not be sent to
  Miss C. for instruction. But it seems that for some wide reason he has since
  concluded to omit the proposed clause.

  information on the Statute, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>Prudence Crandall</p>
<p>
  Miss Crandall was originally brought before Rufus Adams, Esq. a Justice of the
  Peace for Windham County, by a warrant issued by him on a complaint by the
  Grand Juror of the town of Canterbury, charging her with violating a statute
  law of the State of Connecticut passed at the last session of the Legislature
  in regard to teaching, boarding, harboring, &amp;c. persons of color, not
  inhabitants of the State. She entered a demurrer to the complaint, the Court
  judged the complaint sufficient and thereupon ordered Miss Crandall to give
  bond with surety in the sum of $150, for her appearance before the next County
  Court to be tried on said complaint, and abide the judgment of said Court
  thereon. Failing to procure bonds, she was committed to prison. The cause came
  on for trial before the County Court on Friday, August 23d: C.F. Cleaveland,
  Esq. the Attorney for the State, being absent from indisposition, the Court
  appointed Jonathan A. Welch, Esq. special attorney to conduct the prosecution.
  A.T. Judson and I. Bulkley, Esqrs. were associate counsel.&nbsp; Hon. Calvin
  Goddard, Hon. W. W. Ellsworth and Henry Strong, Esq. appeared for the defence.
  The jury being empannelled and sworn, the counsel for the defence objected to
  one of the jurors from Canterbury on the ground that he had signed petitions,
  &amp;c. in respect to Miss Crandall’s school, and taken active measures to put
  it down. The Court sustained the objection, and the juror was excused. They
  also objected to another of the jurors on the ground that he was a member of
  the Legislature which passed the law, was one of those who voted for it, and
  had, of course, formed an opinion with respect to its constitutionality. The
  Court decided that the juror was competent to sit. (He got excused, however,
  on account of sickness.) The information against Miss Crandall consisted of
  two counts. The first charged “that the said Prudence Crandall, on the 24
  <sup>th</sup>
  day of June last, with force, and arms, in a certain school which before that
  time had been and then was set up in said Canterbury, for the instruction and
  teaching of colored persons, to wit: Theodosia De Grasse, Ann Peterson, Amelia
  Elizabeth Wilder, Ann Eliza Hammond, and others whose names are unknown, who
  at the time so taught and instructed were not inhabitants of any town in this
  state, which said acts were done, by the said Prudence Crandall, without the
  consent, in writing, first had and obtained of a majority of the civil
  authority and select men of the said town of Canterbury, within which said
  school was then instructed, against the peace of this state, and contrary to
  the form and effect of the statute in such case made and provided.”
</p>
<p>
  The second count charged “that the defendant, with force and arms did wilfully
  and knowingly harbor and board, and aid and assist in harboring and boarding
  certain colored persons (named above,) who, when so harbored and boarded, were
  not inhabitants of any town in this State—without the consent in writing of
  the civil authority and select men, &amp;c.”
</p>
<p>Plea, Not Guilty.</p>
<p>The following witnesses were then called on the part of the prosecution.</p>
<p>
  <em>Asahel Bacon</em>
  said that he had called at Miss Crandall’s house in the month of June last,
  having heard that she had taken some scholars from abroad. Capt. Sanger
  accompanied him. They were both select men of the town. Miss Crandall invited
  them into her house very politely. They asked her in relation to her scholars.
  She said she had four who were from New York and one from Hartford.—She called
  them in and introduced them. Theodosia De Grass, Amelia Elizabeth Wildes, and
  Catherine Ann Weldon, he thinks were the names of those called. Witness did
  not remember the day of the month that he called—thinks it was the day after
  the girls came—certainly soon after.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ebenezer Sanger</em>
  coincided in the statement of Mr. Bacon.
</p>
<p>
  <em>George Cady</em>
  had conversed with Miss Crandall—went to her house on Friday last to summon as
  witnesses to support this prosecution, some of the girls who were attending
  the school. One of those named in this subpoena said that she had been sent
  for him, on account of the sickness of her mother, and wished him to excuse
  her attendance at Court—told her that he could not, but would state the
  circumstances to the public prosecutor. Miss Crandall said that she did not
  see that there was any need of witnesses at all, for she should confess that
  she had broken the law.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ann Peterson,</em>
  This witness was a colored girl, said to be a pupil of Miss Crandall, and was
  one of those named in the information to whom Miss C. had given instruction.
  Mr. Ellsworth objected to the examination of the witness on the ground that
  she could not testify without implicating herself. Mr. Welch read the clause
  of the statute under which this prosecution was sustained, in which it was
  enacted that the pupils in a school kept contrary to the act, might be
  compelled to testify. Mr. Ellsworth said that he denied, altogether, the
  competency of the Legislature to compel a witness to testify, or answer
  questions that might implicate him, even to render himself liable in
  debt—otherwise a witness might be compelled to testify to what would charge
  him with the crime of murder. He alluded to the State Constitution and Bill of
  Rights which he claimed protected every person from criminating himself by
  being compelled to give testimony. It was contrary to fundamental principles.
  In this case the witness might make herself an aider and abettor, and subject
  herself to the penalties imposed by the statute. Mr. Judson claimed that the
  witness would not by her testimony implicate herself. The law was penal, and
  must be construed strictly. Even if she was aware that she was instructed by
  Miss Crandall, it would not charge herself with any crime. Mr. Judson read at
  length from Starkie on evidence, to show that the witness ought, on common law
  principles, to be examined, and was bound to answer questions as to what she
  knew of Miss C.’s school. At all events he claimed that, in this instance,
  such must be the case as the Legislature had expressly enacted that the pupils
  should be witnesses. Mr. Ellsworth, in reply, said he apprehended the question
  to be whether the Legislature possessed the power to compel a witness to
  convict himself. He read from the opinion of Chief Justice Hosmer, in the 8
  <sup>th</sup>
  Con. Rep. and also from the case of the people vs. Mather, in 4
  <sup>th</sup>
  Wendell’s Reps on the subject of examining witnesses.&nbsp; By the principles
  decided these cases, which were the settled law of the land, he claimed that
  the witness was not compelled to answer any questions in relation to her
  knowledge of this school. The Court decided that the witness, under the
  circumstances, was not protected, but must be examined.—The examination was
  about to proceed, when Mr. Ellsworth rose and stated to the Court that the
  witness had been advised not to answer interrogatories in regard to her
  knowledge of this school. He felt it to be his duty now to repeat this advice.
  He wished the Court, however, distinctly to understand that the counsel for
  the accused had taken this course not with a view to embarrass the trial, but
  solely from a sense of duty. He conscientiously believed that the legal rights
  of the witness were such that she should not be compelled to testify. The
  Counsel for the prosecution, asked the witness when she came to Canterbury,
  but she declined answering the question. A number of other questions were then
  proposed to the witness, the principal of which were—“Has Miss Crandall kept a
  school for colored girls not inhabitants of this state?”—“Will you say whether
  the defendant has or has not instructed any person of color other than
  yourself since the 10
  <sup>th</sup>
  of June last, or boarded and instructed colored persons not inhabitants of
  this state?” To all these and other questions of a similar character, the
  witness decline giving an answer, on the ground that she could not do so
  without criminating herself. The counsel for the prosecution then called
  <em>Catherine Ann Weldon</em>
  and
  <em>Eliza Hammond,</em>
  both girls of color, and charged with being pupils of Miss Crandall, and
  propounded to them the same questions as above; but they for the same reason,
  and by the advice of counsel, declined answering. The prosecuting Attorney
  reserved to himself, though he waived for the present, the right of moving for
  an order that these witnesses be committed for a contempt of court.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Jacob C. Gould</em>
  said he was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond. She belonged to Providence R.I.
  had known her since she was a child—was the daughter of Thomas Hammond, who
  died in 1826. Her mother now lived in Providence—the father at his death was
  worth from 1500 to $2000 in real estate.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Levi Kneeland,</em>
  Was not connected with Miss Crandall’s school except as an adviser in relation
  to it—was pastor of the Church to which Miss Crandall belonged—had seen
  several of the colored girls who were present at his church during the summer.
  In reply to a question whether he had seen one of the girls elsewhere than at
  his church declined answering. In reply to the question whether he had not
  seen one of them at Miss Crandall’s, declined answering—decline to answer
  whether he had advised Miss Crandall in relation to her school. Declined
  answering whether or not he had been in Miss Crandall’s school since the 10
  <sup>th</sup>
  of June last. The court, having decided that he was bound to answer the
  questions put to him, and that the reasons he offered for refusing to do so,
  namely, that he might subject himself to a prosecution, and entangle himself
  in difficulties, were insufficient, granted a motion for a mittimus to commit
  him to prison and he was taken into custody by the Sheriff.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Eliza Parkis</em>
  (a woman of color) was acquainted with Ann Eliza Hammond, one of the girls
  that Miss Crandall was charged with having instructed. Has seen her in
  Providence—has also seen her at Miss Crandall’s, and slept in a room with Miss
  De Grasse a colored girl from New York. Miss Crandall employed witness to work
  for her, because she said she did not wish to keep her scholars out of school
  to do the work. Never saw any of the girls in school.—Have seen them have
  books and study them.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Rowland Greene</em>
  (affirmed) Has often heard that Miss Crandall kept a school for colored girls
  in Canterbury—has been at the house often, was called as a physician—went
  there and saw several colored girls—heard some of them recite in grammar,
  geography, &amp;c. Some of the girls has been at his own house. Has seen a
  little girl there, said to be from New York—has heard Miss Crandall talk
  concerning her scholars from abroad—does not recollect to have heard her say
  that they were from New York.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Mr. Kneeland</em>
  was not placed at the bar by the Sheriff at his request, and said he intended
  no disrespect to the Court by declining to answer the interrogatories put to
  him, and being advised that he should not implicate himself by doing so, he
  was ready to answer. He proceeded to state that he had visited Miss Crandall’s
  school twice. Once it was under the charge of another person. He had prayed in
  the school and conversed with the girls on religious subjects—does not
  remember faces as well as people in general—could not therefore positively
  identify any one of those present as being the ones seen at Miss
  Crandall’s—should think they were—his best belief on the subject would be a
  guess—has taken meals at Miss Crandall’s and eaten with her pupils—has heard
  them recite their lessons—thinks he has heard Miss Hammond spoken of either by
  the defendant or her sister. Miss Crandall has conversed with him in relation
  to her scholars—thinks she has told him that some of them were from New York,
  and some from Providence and New-Haven.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Albert Hinckley,</em>
  has been at Miss Crandall’s several times since the month of June last—does
  not know whether he has been in her school room as he knows not in which room
  it is kept, has not conversed with her on the subject of the residence of her
  scholars—called on her as a friend and conversed on various topics—has heard
  that she kept a school for colored persons—has heard her speak of her scholars
  and school—has seen colored ladies at her house and has taken tea with
  them—cannot say whether any of those present were the ones or not.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Eliza Glasko,</em>
  This witness was a colored girl belonging to the school but an inhabitant of
  this state. The same objection was made to examining her as was before made in
  respect to the others, but the objection was overruled by the Court. She
  however declined answering the questions propounded to her. The prosecuting
  attorney moved the court for a mittimus to commit the witness for contempt of
  court. The court granted the motion and ordered the clerk to make out a
  mittimus.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hezekiah Crandall,</em>
  (affirmed) His sister Prudence keeps a school at Canterbury for colored
  girls—knows Ann Eliza Hammond—could not certainly recognize any other that was
  present except perhaps Ann Peterson—has never been in the school nor heard the
  pupils recite—has seen Ann Eliza Hammond at his sisters, often, during June
  and July,—supposed she boarded there and was instructed by his sisters with
  others—knows by sight and name Amelia Wildes—does not know where she is
  now—has not heard his sister say any thing on the subject of her school for
  some time—she has resided in Canterbury some portion of the time for twelve
  years past.
</p>
<p>
  <em>James Chandler</em>
  said he was at Miss Crandall’s several times last spring (not being able to
  say with certainty whether he had been there since the passage of the law he
  was not interrogated farther.)
</p>
<p>
  <em>George Roberts</em>
  went to Miss Crandall’s about five months ag and carried a colored girl, Miss
  Hammond to the school—Miss Hammond it was said belonged to Providence, has
  been at Miss C’s since that time perhaps within ten weeks and drank tea—he
  then saw Miss Hammond but does not know whether she boarded there constantly
  or not—he heard her and other colored girls recite in Miss Crandall’s
  school—should think this was two or three months ago—has been at Miss C’s
  within a week but did not as he remembers see any of the girls present there
  at that time.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Mary Benson</em>
  (affirmed) Has been at Miss Crandall’s school and found it very
  interesting—was never present but for a short time—‘tis for colored
  persons—saw Ann Eliza Hammond there—she is one of the scholars and boards with
  Miss C.—Witness recognized several of those present as among the number she
  had seen at Miss Crandall’s—one of the pupils, Ann Weldon was from
  New-York—Miss Hammond was from Providence—witness was at Miss Crandall’s five
  weeks since and took tea—several colored girls were at the table—does not know
  where any of them belonged except by report—visited the school when it was
  near closing and heard Miss C. give the girls instruction in Geography and
  Arithmetic. The prosecuting Attorney here rested his evidence, and the sheriff
  having served his process on Eliza Glasko was about committing her to prison,
  when Mr. Ellsworth interposed and stated to the court that rather than have
  the girl committed he should advise her to testify—again repeating that the
  course of the defendant’s counsel in relation to the testimony of these girls,
  was dictated by an imperious sense of professional duty.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Eliza Glasko</em>
  the proceeded to give testimony. She said she was a member of Miss C’s school,
  and that the other girls near her were also members—one of them from
  Providence, the other said to be from New-York—the ordinary branches were
  taught them by Miss C.—reading, writing, grammar, geography, &amp;c., witness
  begun to go on the first of April—the school was usually opened and closed
  with prayer—the scriptures were read and explained daily in the school—some
  portions were committed to memory by the pupils and considered a part of their
  education.
</p>
<p>Mr. Judson then opened the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>
<p>
  He first stated the case and read the Act of the Legislature which he claimed
  that Miss Crandall had violated. He said that this act did not prevent any
  black from attending the district schools in the State, or any higher
  schools—that they had all the benefits of the school fund, and might attend the
  academies, high schools, or colleges, and that too whether they were citizens
  of this state, of other states, or of any part of the world. The sole
  intention and provision of the act was, that colored persons, from another
  jurisdiction, should not be intruded into any town in this state, without a
  written permission from the select men and civil authority of the town in
  which they proposed to reside. This was all, and this was perfectly lawful.
  The whole tenor and effect of the law was to place a school for colored
  persons under the care and supervision of the select men and civil authority
  of each town. He should ask the attention of the Court to the face that the
  Legislature had exercised a controlling power over schools within the limits
  of the state since 1717. (Mr. Judson here read from an old edition of the
  statutes, in respect to the power which the Legislature had exercised over
  schools in respect to preventing disorders and the application of the public
  money.)—These said Mr. Judson, were schools for the instruction of all
  classes, and the acts which he had read, showed that the Legislature thought
  proper to exercise care over these schools. Such was the ancient policy of the
  state, and this new law was no change of policy. The state owed its present
  honors, its present glories, to pursuing this policy of keepings its schools
  under a supervising power. Nor was there anything in the Constitution of the
  United States to prevent it. Towns, he claimed, had a right to say who should
  be allowed to become inhabitants by residence in their limits and this law
  gave them no more power than was necessary for the exercise of that right.
  That the law was illiberal and reflected disgrace on the State, on the
  Legislature which enacted it, he denied. On the contrary, said Mr. J., there
  are now more than 1500 schools in the state, supported by our fund of
  $1,800,000, to which blacks may go without the payment of a cent. Small as the
  state was, smaller than single counties in some other states, these facts were
  true concerning it. For himself he was proud of it. Where could a parallel be
  found in the universe?
</p>
<p>
  Public policy, continued Mr. J., absolutely demands that a law of this
  description should be maintained. It was claimed to be unconstitutional
  because exclusive in its operation on a particular class. Other laws of the
  state were liable to the same objection. Physicians and lawyers were instances
  of the operation of our exclusive law. Tanners, Taverners, Surveyors, &amp;c.
  must all be licensed. Manufactories were liable to be visited by the select
  men and civil authority for the purpose of seeing that the children employed
  in them were properly educated. If persons came here from other states and set
  up manufacturing establishments they were equally liable to be visited in this
  way though no such provisions existed in the laws of the states from whence
  they come. Lawyers in this state could not purchase choses [sic] in action. All
  these laws, with many similar ones, were passed in derogation of rights
  originally common to all; public policy however, required the enactment of
  them, as it did of the one in question, and in his opinion they all stood on
  similar grounds, and were, without question, in accordance with the
  Constitution.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. J. next referred to the course which other states had pursued in
  legislating on the subject of the blacks. He remarked on the law of Ohio. Our
  law is not, said Mr. J., an act of exclusion, nor an act of prohibition. It
  does not pretend to send away those who belong here, nor does it prohibit any
  from coming, but only makes it necessary that permission be first obtained.
  The laws of Georgia and North Carolina went so far as to authorise the
  imprisonment of blacks who came within their limits, even though they came in
  the capacity of cooks and stewards of vessels. In Tennessee blacks could not
  come from other states and remain within the state above twelve days without
  incurring penalties. In Maryland a man could not manumit his slave without his
  leaving the state. Even in Pennsylvania, “the land of Penn,” no free negro
  could remain without giving bonds for his support. All these laws Mr. J.
  claimed to be obnoxious to equal and indeed to greater constitutional
  objections than the one in question. The article in the constitution of the
  United States with which this law was supposed to conflict, he understood to
  be, the 2d section of the 4
  <sup>th</sup>
  article:—“The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges
  and immunities of citizens in the several states.” Mr. J. claimed that the
  term “citizens” in this place, and throughout the constitution, had a
  technical signification—a legal meaning—that it did not include colored
  persons—that they were not be the constitution recognized as citizens. A
  certain class of colored persons, (slaves) were in it considered as property.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. J. here referred to the laws of the United State on the subject of
  naturalization, reading from Ingersoll’s Digest, the several acts of Congress,
  and insisted that from them all, the language being precise, technical, and
  certain, none other than white persons could be naturalized citizens of the
  United States. He also read from the 2
  <sup>nd</sup>
  Kent’s Com. 70, 71, 72, by which he further illustrated these views.
</p>
<p>
  There have been, continued Mr. J., concurrent acts of the State of Connecticut
  which give the same construction to the constitution. If “citizen” do not mean
  a white person only—if it be claimed that a black is a citizen, then is the
  constitution of our own State a nullity, for it allows “free white males”
  alone to be electors. The privilege of being a freeman, he claimed, to be a
  higher one that the right of being educated. Why should a man be educated who
  could not be a freeman? A person who pays a single cent State tax, or who does
  military duty, is entitled to the privilege of voting. In Massachusetts these
  qualifications were not sufficient. Each state in the Union has these local
  laws and customs peculiar to itself—these must all be abrogated at a blow, by
  deciding the law in question to be unconstitutional. Full effect however,
  might be given to the clause in the constitution, referred to without
  producing this result, and that was, by construing the term “citizen” in the
  manner he had before pointed out.
</p>
<p>
  The first act in our own statute would be nullified by a decision that this
  law was unconstitutional—a citizen of another State cannot maintain an action
  in our courts for any cause unless a substantial inhabitant of the State give
  bond for him. No one has doubted the constitutionality of this law, and the
  law in question, with respect to constitutionality, could not be distinguished
  from it.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. J. said he should conclude his remarks on this subject by alluding merely
  to one other argument in support of this law, and that was, that the public
  safety of this State, the preservation of its true interests, required this
  law to be enforced. The southern States might emancipate their slaves and send
  them all to Connecticut instead of Liberia. The influx of that species of
  population might be so great as to be overwhelming. (Mr. J. proceeded to
  remark on the effect which recent measures of the British Parliament, on the
  subject of slavery, might have on this question, when he was interrupted by
  the court, who remarked that tho’ far from inclined to restrain all the limits
  of the discussion, yet it did not seem pertinent to the issue to argue the
  policy or expediency of the laws. Mr. J. said he would not press the point.)
  Mr. J. hoped that he had not been misunderstood in the remarks he had made. He
  wished not to oppress any class of population. He heartily wished that every
  slave might be emancipated that every day. But if it could not be done without
  destruction to our constitutions, and desolating our land, he could not desire
  it.
</p>
<p>
  He would only add to the Jury that though it was true they were at liberty to
  consider what the court said to them on the subject of the law, as advice,
  still he hoped they would pay it such respect as advice from the bench was
  properly entitled to. A single word as to the facts. The information charged
  the defendant with boarding and instructing, in different counts. It was
  sufficient if they found her guilty on either. The day was immaterial. If they
  found her guilty of doing the act charged on any day, since the passage of the
  law, and before the filing of the information, ‘twas sufficient. It was not
  necessary that they should find that she had boarded or instructed each of the
  persons named in the information; to instruct or board one was a transgression
  of the law.
</p>
<p>As to the proof it was abundant, conclusive.</p>
<p>
  Mr. Ellsworth, after stating the case, and remarking on the prohibitions of
  the law, said that he proposed not to occupy time in relation to the facts of
  the case. He would willingly have advised the pupils of Miss Crandall to have
  testified had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily surrendered
  their most sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this
  school—‘twas no secret, and whether that constituted a crime or not was for
  the jury to determine. In order to convict my client, said Mr. E., you
  gentlemen, must find on your oaths that she had committed a crime. You may
  find that she has violated an act of the State Legislature, but if you also
  find her protected by a higher power, it will be your duty to acquit. The
  court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that the law was
  unconstitutional, if they so believed, but after all, it belonged to the people
  to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one of the
  jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed. He
  flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that
  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of
  the United States. The constitution of the United States was the highest power
  known in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go and if the jury find the
  law not to stand well with the constitution they must say so.
</p>
<p>
  The real question for the jury to settle Mr. Ellsworth apprehended to be this:
  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of
  other States from coming into this State, and there residing, to
  prosecute the acquisition of knowledge, in a way open to the citizens of this
  State. This he believed was the precise question, and it reached deep and
  wide—wider and deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was however claimed by his
  friend from Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens, and that the
  provisions of the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United States,
  did not apply to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship
  was complexion in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I, said Mr.
  E., make the criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that
  none but white persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of
  citizenship by birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a
  citizen of our soil? In the days of Revolution, said Mr. E., these men fought
  side by side with our fathers, and shed their blood for their country—the
  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance. Their names were now
  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now received the
  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said Mr. E., does
  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen, depend
  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection of
  his rights in every State could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here read
  a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,
  which, he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,
  ought to be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced
  between each clause,) Mr. E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as
  much a republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend
  was not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the
  Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own
  constitution, continued Mr. E., recognized, in express terms, equality of
  rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add
  “except black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such
  doctrine go forth from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is
  justly entitled, to equal representation in the Congress of the United States
  with the white population. Could not a black man commit treason? The gentleman
  would have it that he could not, for none other than citizens can. (Mr. E.
  here read from the 2
  <sup>nd</sup>
  Kent’s Com on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout the idea, said
  Mr. E., that a man, born here by the side of me, is not a citizen because, his
  father was black, while I am a citizen because mine was white.

Dreadful Effects of Immediate Emancipation	The Unionist	Abolition; Haiti	"<p align=""center"">DREADFUL EFFECTS OF IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION</p>
<p align=""center"">[From a pamphlet recently published in England.}</p>
<p>
  Of the many persons who declare themselves averse to slavery and yet afraid to
  join in measures for its abolition, some perhaps have not paid much attention
  to the instances of emancipation that have already taken place. If any such
  will take the trouble to read the following account of the effects of
  emancipation as far as it has hitherto been tried, they will perhaps see that
  their fears on the subject are not justified by experience.
</p>
<p>
  The History of Hayti when separated from the accidental circumstances
  attending it, furnishes irrefragable evidence of the safety and advantage of
  immediate emancipation. It is true that much blood was shed there during the
  French revolution; but this was not owing to the emancipation of the slaves,
  but was the consequence either of the civil war which preceded the act of
  emancipation; or of the atrocious attempt to restore slavery.
</p>
<p>
  In September, 1793, Polvirel, one of the Commissioners sent to St. Domingo by
  the National Convention, issues a proclamation declaring the whole of the
  slaves in the island free. Colonel Malenfant, a slave proprietor, resident at
  the time in the island, thus describes the effects of this sudden measure.
  “After this public act of emancipation, the Negroes remained quiet both in the
  south and in the west, and they continued to work upon all the plantations.
  There were estates which had neither owners nor managers resident upon them,
  and on those estates where no white men were left to direct them, they betook
  themselves to the planting of provisions; but upon all plantations where the
  whites resided, the blacks continued to labor as quietly as before.” Colonel
  Malenfant says, that when many of his neighbors, proprietors or managers, were
  in prison, the negroes of their plantations came to him to beg him to direct
  them in their work. “If you will take care not to talk to them of the
  restoration of slavery, but talk to them of freedom, you may with this word
  chain them down to their labor. How did Toussaint succeed?—How did I succeed
  before is time in the plain of the Culde-Sac on the plantation Gourand, during
  more than eight months after liberty had been granted to the slaves? Let those
  who knew me at that time, let the blacks themselves, be asked: they will all
  reply that not a single negro upon that plantation, consisting of more than
  four hundred and fifty laborers, refused to work: and yet this plantation was
  thought to be under the worst discipline and the slaves the most idle of any
  in the plain. I inspired the same activity into three other plantations of
  which I had the management. If all the negroes had come from Africa within six
  months, if they had the love of independence that the Indians have, I should
  own that force must be employed; but ninety-nine out of a hundred of the
  blacks are aware that without labor they cannot procure the things that are
  necessary for them; that there is no other method of satisfying their wants
  and their tastes. They know that they must work; the wish to do so, and they
  will do so.”
</p>
<p>
  Such was the conduct of the negroes for the first nine months after their
  liberation, or up to the middle of 1794. In the latter part of 1796, Malenfant
  says, “The colony was flourishing under Toussaint, the whites lived happily
  and in peace upon their estates, and the negroes continued to work for them”
  General Lecroix who published his “Memoirs for a history of St. Domingo” in
  1819, says that in 1797 the most wonderful progress had been made in
  agriculture. “The Colony,” said he, “marched as by enchantment towards its
  ancient splendor: cultivation prospered; every day produced perceptible proof
  of its progress.” General Vincent, who was a general of brigade of artillery
  in St. Domingo and a proprietor of estates in the island, was sent by
  Toussaint to Paris in 1801 to lay before the Directory the new constitution
  which had been agreed upon in St. Domingo. He arrived in France just at the
  moment of the peace of Amiens, and found that Bonaparte was preparing an
  armament for the purpose of restoring slavery in St. Domingo. He remonstrated
  against the expedition; he stated that it was totally unnecessary and
  therefore criminal, for that every thing was going on well in St. Domingo. The
  proprietors were in peaceable possessions of their estates; cultivation was
  making rapid progress; the blacks were industrious and beyond example happy.
  He conjured him, therefore not to reverse this beautiful state of things, but
  his efforts were ineffectual, and the expedition arrived upon the shores of
  St. Domingo. At length, however, the French were driven from the island. Till
  that time the planters had retained their property, and then it was, and not
  till then, that they lost their all. In 1804 Dessalines was proclaimed
  Emperor; in process of time a great part of the black troops were disbanded,
  and returned to cultivation again. From that time to this, there has been no
  want of subordination or industry among them.
</p>
<p>
  The following account of the character and condition of the negroes of Hayti,
  at a later period, is taken from “Sketches of Hayti” by Mr. Harvey, who during
  the latter part of the reign of Christophe spent a considerable time at Cape
  François the capital of his dominions. “The cultivators who formed the great
  mass of the population, resided on or near the plantations of which they were
  appointed to labor. A great proportion of them were engaged in cultivating the
  estates of the king; if soldiers, they were fed and clothed at his expense; if
  regular cultivators, they received such a share of the produce as was fully
  adequate to yield them a competent maintenance. Others were in the employ of
  the nobles and officers, who received either stated wages or such a portion of
  the article they cultivated as was deemed a sufficient reward for their
  industry, were equally supplied with whatever could contribute to their
  comfort. And those who by their exertions and economy were enabled to procure
  small spots of land of their own or to hold the smaller plantations at an
  annual rent, were diligently engaged in cultivating coffee, sugar, and other
  articles, which they disposed of to the inhabitants of the adjacent towns and
  villages. It was an interesting sight to behold this class of the Haytians, now
  in possession of their freedom, coming in groups to the market nearest which
  they resided, bringing the produce of their industry for sale; and afterwards
  returning, carrying back the necessary articles of living which the disposal
  of their commodities had enabled them to purchase; all evidently cheerful and
  happy. Nor could it fail to occur to the mind that their present condition
  furnished the most satisfactory answer to that objection to the general
  emancipation of slaves, founded on their alleged unfitness to value and
  improve the benefits of liberty.
</p>
<p>
  Though of the same race and possessing the same general traits of character as
  the negroes of the other West India islands, they are already distinguished
  from them by habits of industry and activity such as slaves are seldom known
  to exhibit. As they would not suffer, so they do not require the attendance of
  one acting in the capacity of a driver with the instrument of punishment in
  his hand.—As far as I had an opportunity of ascertaining from what fell under
  my own observation, and from what I gathered from other European residents, I
  am persuaded of one general fact which on account of its importance I shall
  state in the most explicit terms, viz: that the Haytians employed in
  cultivating the plantations, as well as the rest of the population, perform as
  much work in a given time as they were accustomed to do during their
  subjection to the French. And if we may judge of their future improvement by
  the change which has already effected, it may be reasonably anticipated that
  Hayti will ere long contain a population not inferior in their industry to
  that of any civilized nation in the world.
</p>
<p>
  While the interior of this island was in this improving state, and its
  inhabitants were peaceful and industrious, Cape Francois and other towns
  presented scenes of the utmost order and activity: the great majority of the
  inhabitants of Cape Francois consisted of trades-people and mechanics, the
  former of whom were supplied by the resident merchants with cloths, linens,
  silks and other manufactures, which they sold to the natives in small
  quantities. Their business was seldom so great as to enable them to amass
  fortunes, but it afforded them ample means of support. Towards strangers who
  entered their shops, whether for the purpose of making purchases or not, they
  were invariably and remarkably civil; a trait in the character of Christophe’s
  subjects which I believe to have been universal. The mechanics, though many of
  them were deficient in skill from having been imperfectly instructed, were all
  enabled by their industry to gain a competent maintenance. On the whole, the
  scene which Cape Francois presented was as interesting as it was in many
  respects surprising. In few places of commerce could there be seen greater
  regularity in the despatch [sic] of business, greater diligence displayed by
  those engaged in it, or more evident marks of a prosperous state of things.
  Every man had some calling to occupy his attention; instances of idleness or
  intemperance were of rare occurrence, the most perfect subordination
  prevailed, and all appeared contented and happy. A foreigner would have found
  it difficult to persuade himself on his first entering the place, that the
  people he now beheld so submissive, industrious and contented, were the same
  people who a few years before has escaped from the shackles of slavery.”
</p>
<p>
  A gentleman who had been for upwards of twenty years past a general merchant
  in Hayti, frequently crossing to Europe and America, gave the following
  account of the condition of the Haytians to Capt. Stuart at Belfast last
  winter. The present population he supposes consists of at least seven hundred
  thousand. He said that there was very universal happiness amongst them,—and
  that though their conduct was not unexceptionable, yet there was a less
  distress, than in any other country of his knowledge. That they obtained
  abundance by their own labor.—There were no paupers except the decrepid [sic]
  and aged: that the people were very charitable, hospitable and kind, very
  respectful to Europeans, temperate, grateful, faithful, orderly and submissive,
  easily governable, lively and contented, good mechanics, and that no corporal
  punishments are allowed.
</p>
"	Ye gads this article is objectionable. It is all about how much the Haitians fit European and capitalist models. Subordination and submission, and the unquestioned superiority of European thought, systems and people is grating.	The argument implicit in this account - that once emancipated, people of African descent will behave like Europeans, and even retain a sense of their place in the hierarchic order - was far too common in these early days of Immediate Abolition. This is, to my ears, another misstep along the road to true allyship between white Abolitionists and African-Americans. On a more positive note, the presence of Haiti as a symbol of Black achievement and independence, was always important, as is borne out in the writings of African-Americans like David Walker, Maria Stewart, and Henry Highland Garnet.

<p align=""center"">
  SALISBURY CATHEDRAL—STONEHENGE—THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN
</p>
<p align=""right"">
  <em>Salisbury, July</em>
  2, 1833.
</p>
<p>
  The shepherd of Salisbury Plain, Stonehenge, Old Sarum, and Salisbury
  Cathedral are things of some note. The latter is distinguished for its lofty
  spire, four hundred feet; for the purity and uniformity of its architecture,
  external and internal; and for the warped condition of the columns of masonry,
  which support the tower and spire, under the amazing weight that rests upon
  them, and then look us and observe [indecipherable] ready to be crushed. And
  the only reason why it is presumed they will remain, is because they have
  already endured for ages under the same appearances. An extra fixture has been
  thrown in for protection, interposing a monstrous blemish in the perspective
  of the transept. Aside from this the pure Gothic of the entire edifice,
  constitutes the rarest beauty of the kind in the British Isles. It was built
  in the thirteenth century—the spire having been since added, the top of which
  inclines 22 inches from a perpendicular line, in consequence of the warping of
  its supports. An old man now between seventy and eighty, has been accustomed
  to ascend once in a twelve month for many years to oil the weather vane. He
  gets out at a window a few feet below the top, scrambles like a squirrel by
  some iron net work at the giddy elevation of four hundred feet, performs his
  office, and descends with all the self-possession of a sailor. This year,
  however, he has been unable to do his duty on account of the infirmities of
  age.
</p>
<p>
  I rode this morning in a fly, a sort of hackney-coach, drawn by a couple of
  mules, to
  <em>Stonehenge,</em>
  about eight miles from the town, situated in the heart of Salisbury plain, and
  standing insolated in all the grandeur of its mysterious and hitherto
  unexplained history. It is a truly sublime object—sublime in itself, as
  filling the mind with wonder, where the stones came from, how they could have
  been brought there, and placed in their relative positions! The heaviest
  columns are rated at seventy tons—the whole number being ninety-four, as near
  as can be ascertained, although the present confusion of the assemblage
  renders it difficult to count them. It is supposed to have been a Druidical
  temple, where human sacrifices were offered—a superstition as sublime as it
  was diabolical, as mysterious as cruel! The rude grandeur of the work
  demonstrates the barbarity of the age. There are no indications, that this
  place of sacrifice was ever enclosed by walls, or covered by a roof. It is
  encircled indeed by the traces of a ditch and a corresponding embankment, and
  the columnar ranges of stones were set up in circular lines, at greater
  distance from each other than the space occupied. About half an acre is
  enclosed by the circumvallation, and a quarter of an acre occupied by the
  temple itself. The only junction of the structure if structure it can be
  called, appears to have been the resting of the amazing cross and horizontal
  slabs on the largest columns, about 20 ft. high &amp; 15 asunder, most of
  which have fallen, some are inclined, and a few only standing erect. Tenons
  were left on the top of the perpendicular columns, entering grooves of the
  horizontal pieces laid upon them. It is barely possible, that the mechanical
  powers of the present age could set up an edifice like this; but the rudeness
  of the work does not naturally suggest the knowledge and application of such
  powers at the time of its creation. Hence the wonder.
</p>
<p>
  It is said by some, that the same material is not to be found in this island.
  It is incredible, however, that these immense rocks should have been shipped;
  and almost equally incredible, that they should have been transported any
  considerable distance on trundles; and yet they were never found in this
  vicinity. Many of them are reduced to nearly right angles, but more exhibit a
  smooth, or properly plane surface. There is nothing like the skill of masonry
  bestowed upon them. They are perhaps purposely left in this rude state, as
  emblematic of the stern and inexorable rites which they were set up to
  witness. The supposed altar piece lies in the centre, embedded in the earth,
  and directly behind it two of the largest columns supported the heaviest
  cross-beam—but the columns have inclined and dropped their burden.
</p>
<p>
  There are other relics of the kind in the island, but none so stupendous. All
  the parts of a similar temple have been transferred at great expense from the
  island of Jersey, and set up on the estate of a private gentleman at
  Henley-on-Thames, now the property of a Mr. Maitland. I stumbled upon it the
  other day in rambling over the grounds with a friend, and found it perched on
  a hill some four or five hundred feet above the bed of the Thames. It was
  brought over by a former governor of the island, Gen. Conway, who then owned
  Park-place, on which it now stands. It is of course a small chapel, compared
  with
  <em>Stonehenge</em>
  on Salisbury Plain—but many of the stones are of several tons weight. They are
  rude and shapeless.
</p>
<p>
  There are numerous marks of ancient military fortifications, scattered over
  Salisbury Plain; and tumuli of the ancient dead, such as are to be found in
  the Western regions of our own country, lift up their heads in various
  quarters, and sometimes in groups.
</p>
<p>
  Old Sarum, of recent fame, as a rotten borough of England, sending two members
  to Parliament under the late
  <em>regime</em>
  , is a naked fortification in ruins, two miles from Salisbury. It is as
  desolate as the crown of Ben Nevis in Scotland.
</p>
<p>
  My sensations in visiting Stonehenge were the result of a singular combination
  of the grateful recollections of Mrs. More’s Shepherd and his family, and of
  the actual scenes before me. “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” was continually
  ringing in my ear, and all his history passing before me, as I rode over these
  undulating, naked, and apparently boundless fields, among the tumuli and
  traces of ancient fortifications, and came at last to gaze upon and admire
  this wonder-exciting and unaccountable relic of a barbarous age and bloody
  superstition. What a demonstration of man’s susceptibilities of religious
  affections, of a sense of guilt, of his need of atonement, and of the dreadful
  errors, into which he may be plunged without the guidance of a divine
  revelation!
</p>

While it is interesting that this occupies part of page one, in the very midst of the trial over the Black Law, the discussion about religious sensibilities in this reflective travelogue certainly speaks to the Romantic spirit, and the emergence in New England of Emersonian Transcendentalism at this same time.

Wonderful memory of Blind Alick	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler	"<em>Wonderful memory of Blind Alick.</em>
—There is still living at Stirling, a blind old beggar known to all the country
round by the name of blind Alick, who possesses a memory of almost incredible
strength. It was observed with astonishment, that, when he was a man, and
obliged, by the death of his parents, to gain a livelihood by begging through
the streets of his native town of Stirling, he knew the whole of the Bible, both
Old and New Testaments, by heart! From which you may repeat any passage, and he
will tell you the chapter and verse; or you may tell him the chapter and verse,
and he will repeat to you the passage, word for word. Not long since, a
gentleman, to puzzle him, read, with a slight verbal alteration, a verse of the
Bible. Alick hesitated a moment, and then told where it was to be found but said
it had not been correctly delivered; he then gave it as it stood in the book,
correcting the slight error that had been purposely introduced. The gentleman
then asked him for the 90
<sup>th</sup>
verse of the 7
<sup>th</sup>
chapter of Numbers. Alick was again puzzled for a moment, but then said hastily,
“You are fooling me, sir? there is no such verse—that chapter has only 89
verses.” Several other experiments of the sort were tried upon him with the same
success. He has often been questioned the day after any particular sermon or
speech, and his examiners have invariably found, that, had their patience
allowed, blind Alick would have given them the sermon or speech over again."	Romanticism, but ultimately solid American piety winning, is interesting.	Blind Alick (1766-1839) was a real person, who was contradictorily used both as an example of piety and impiety for his remarkable knowledge of the scriptures. He is now featured in a Ghost Walk in Stirling.	Blind Alick
The Senses Fallible Witnesses	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler	"THE SENSES FALLIBLE WITNESSES.—When we bathe in the sea, or in a cold bath, we
are accustomed to consider the water as colder than the air, and the air colder
than the clothes which surround us. Now all these objects are, in fact, the same
temperature. A thermometer surrounded by the cloth of our coat or suspended in
the atmosphere, or immersed in the sea, will stand at the same temperature. A
linen shirt, when first put on, will feel colder than a cotton one, and a
flannel shirt will actually feel warm; yet all these have the same temperature.
The sheets of the bed feel cold, and the blankets warm; the blankets and sheets,
however, are equally warm. A still, calm atmosphere in summer, feels warm, but
if a wind arises the same atmosphere feels cool. Now, a thermometer suspended
under shelter, and in a calm place, will indicate exactly the same temperature
as a thermometer on which the wind blows."		But can we trust the thermometers?
Commerce of China	The Unionist	Foreign News	"COMMERCE OF CHINA. For more than a century past, almost the whole of European
trade has been restricted to Canton and Macao. But it was not always so. At
different times during the reign of the Ming dynasty, the ports of Ningpo and
Chusan in Chekeang, and the port of Amoy in Fuhkeen, were opened to Europeans,
and became large marts for their commerce. Kanghe in the twenty third year of
his reign opened all the ports of his empire, and allowed a
<em>free trade</em> to his own subjects and to all foreign nations. This regulation continued in
force for about thirty years. But at length it was argued against this
regulation, that foreigners and adventurous Chinese who were living abroad would
improverish the country by exporting large quantities of rice! For this, or some
other reasons equally cogent, foreign trade was restricted; the emigration of
natives and the ingress of foreigners, were prohibited; and, if we mistake not,
the building of vessels on the European model was likewise interdicted. —

Tattling	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler	"TATTLING. “He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life.” It is very common for
young persons to tell every thing they hear, whether they have any grounds for
the belief of what they hear or not. To the injury of an individual something
may be said and spread abroad, when there is not the least shadow of truth in
the story. And it is against this species of tattling which I wish to guard
mankind. The wise man knew how prone the world was to this sin when he said,—“he
that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life.” And truly that person who is careful
what he says—especially when he knows it is in his power to injure the character
of a person, or thwart any of his purposes—acts up to the proverb, and gains the
esteem and friendship of his fellows.—

are those whom it has summoned amid scenes of revelry and idle vanity: there are
those, too, who have heard its ‘still small voice’ amid rural leisure and placid
contentment; but perhaps the knowledge which causeth not to err, is most
frequently impressed upon the mind during seasons of affliction; and tears are
the softened showers which cause the seed of heaven to spring and take root in
the human breast.—

Paean to Motherhood	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler	"<p>
  How little do we appreciate a mother’s tenderness while living! How heedless
  we are in youth of all her anxieties and kindness. But when she is dead and
  gone; when the cares and coldness of the world come withering to our hearts;
  when we find how hard it is to find true sympathy, how few love us for
  ourselves, how few will befriend us in our misfortunes; then it is we think of
  the mother we have lost.

<p align=""center"">(continued.)</p>
<p>
  Mr Ellsworth, after stating the case, and remarking on the prohibitions of the
  law, said that he proposed not to occupy time in relation to the facts of the
  case. He would willingly have advised the pupils of Miss Crandall to have
  testified had he not believed that in so doing they voluntarily surrendered
  their most sacred rights. True it was, the defendant has kept this
  school—‘twas no secret, and whether that constituted a crime or not was for
  the jury to determine. In order to convict my client, said Mr.E., you,
  gentlemen, must find on your oaths that she has committed a crime. You may
  find that she has violated an act of the State legislature, but if you also
  find her protected by a higher power, it will be your duty to acquit. The
  court he was fully assured, would charge the jury that the law was
  unconstitutional, if they so believed, but after all, it belonged to the people
  to determine whether one of them had been guilty of a crime. Each one of the
  jury must be satisfied for himself alone, that a crime has been committed. He
  flattered himself that he should be able to lead them to the conclusion that
  the law in question was a violation of the constitution of this State and of
  the United States.—The constitution of the United States was the highest power
  known in our land. Beyond that, no Legislature can go, and if the jury find
  the law not to stand well with the constitution they must say so.
</p>
<p>
  The real question for the jury to settle Mr Ellsworth apprehended to be this:
  Can the Legislature of Connecticut pass a law prohibiting the citizens of
  other States from coming into this State, and there residing, to prosecute the
  acquisition of knowledge, in a way open to the citizens of this State. This he
  believed was the precise question, and it reached deep and wide—wider and
  deeper than was perhaps imagined. It was however claimed by his friend from
  Canterbury, that colored persons were not citizens, and that the provisions of
  the constitution, with respect to citizens of the United States, did not apply
  to this class of our population. The criterion of citizenship was complexion,
  in the view of the gentleman who had preceded him. I, said Mr E., make the
  criterion to be either birth or naturalization. Admitting that none but white
  persons can be naturalized, it does not touch the question of citizenship by
  birth. Is it so that a person born on our soil, is not a citizen of our soil?
  In the days of Revolution, said Mr E., these men fought side by side with our
  fathers, and shed their blood for this country, which as their country—the
  country to which they owed indefeasible allegiance. Their names were now
  inscribed on the Pension Rolls of the Government—they now received the
  honorable trophies of the services they had rendered. Where, said Mr E., does
  the gentleman get the doctrine that the rights of man, as a citizen, depend
  upon his color? A colored man could appeal to the laws for the protection of
  his rights in every State; could he, if he were not a citizen? (Mr. E. here
  read a few sentences from the commencement of the declaration of independence,
  which, he said, according to the argument of the gentleman opposed to him,
  ought to be changed so as to have the words “except black people” introduced
  between each clause). Mr E. said he was a republican, he claimed to be as much
  of a republican as his friend from Canterbury, and he hoped that his friend
  was not so ashamed of his republicanism, as to wish this instrument, the
  Declaration of Independence, interpolated in this manner. Our own
  constitution, continued Mr E., recognized, in express terms, equality of
  rights—that men were equal in rights, but to this the gentleman would add
  “except black men.” He hoped he should not live long enough to see such
  doctrine go forth from Connecticut. The free colored population has, and is
  justly entitled, to equal representation in the Congress of the United States
  with the white population. Could not a black man commit treason? The gentleman
  would have it that he could not, for none other than citizens can. (Mr E. here
  read from the 2d Kent’s Com. on the subject of citizenship, by birth.) I scout
  the Idea, said Mr E., that a man, born here by the side of me, is not a
  citizen because, his father was black, while I am a citizen because mine was
  white.
</p>
<p>
  Mr E. said that the argument which his friend had drawn from the fact that our
  state constitution provided that none but white citizens should become
  electors, would seem to be based on the assumption that the right of voting
  was a criterion of citizenship. Is this, he asked, the fact? Was the right of
  voting a test of citizenship? If it is, where are our wives and daughters?
  Citizens, or not? Would the gentleman denationalize them? How could persons
  born here be aliens? Mr E. then proceeded to examine more minutely the
  abstract question which he had before stated. It was, he said, a great
  question, one which he had not doubt would make a figure in the future history
  of this country. If, said Mr E., resident citizens of this state may choose
  their own instructors, then, he believe, that citizens from other states, here
  by their sides, may also choose theirs. If the Legislature of Connecticut can
  say to a black citizen of New York that he shall not come here to be
  instructed he may say so to the white citizen. Where is the distinction? It
  comes then to this, our Legislature can say as to the population of an
  adjacent state, for instance New York, it is corrupt, and its citizens shall
  not come within our limits—be they white or black it makes no difference. A
  barrier was thus at once erected around our state. An absurdity so manifest as
  this must strike every mind. Nothing but a high state of excitement could ever
  have caused the enactment of such a law as the present. The citizens of
  Canterbury he had no doubt, would, on reflection, perceive the impropriety of
  their course. The care and supervision which the Legislature had exercised
  over schools in this state did not, as Mr E. apprehended imply the right to
  exercise any such power as that set up in the new law.
</p>
<p>
  The law, which regulate trades and professions, to which allusion has been
  made, were also, he said, of an entirely different character. These
  regulations and restrictions, it must be remembered, were the same for all.
  Whether one belonged to the state or not, these laws knew no difference. The
  new law has made a difference, and in that consisted the difficulty. The
  application of the new law must depend upon the fact whether a person was born
  in or out of the state. The Legislature leave the black man born here, the
  freedom of selecting his own instructor, and the place of instruction for his
  child. This privilege is denied to the black man who comes here, if it so
  happens that he was born out of the state. But, says the gentleman, his
  children may go to the district schools, to any of the high schools of
  academies in the state. The benefits which colored children would derive from
  these schools, said Mr E. would not be worth a pinch of snuff, and the
  gentleman knows it.—The blacks in Hartford had petitioned for a separate
  school, in order that they might have the benefit of the public money, which
  they did not enjoy now, as they were ever made hewers of wood and drawers of
  water, and considered the offscouring of the schools which they attended. They
  made commotion in every school the moment they entered it. There existed then
  a necessity for separate schools.—He was not going abreast of any principle of
  supervision which the state could properly exercise over schools, or over
  trades and professions, by contending for the rights of citizens to choose
  their own instructors, and the place of instruction, for their children,
  whether they were or were not citizens of this state. The old statute in
  relation to paupers was considered as upholding this law. By it, persons
  liable to become chargeable might be warned to depart, and might be publicly
  whipped if they did not obey the mandate. He would here thank his friend from
  Canterbury for obtaining a repeal of that portion of the law by which whipping
  was imposed. Mr E. apprehended that a state possessed the power of preventing
  the settlement, within its limits, of those likely to become paupers, but that
  the state had the power of keeping out every body from other states, he denied
  altogether. Will it be said that the law in question does not go to this extent?
  If a citizen of Massachusetts may come into this state and settle down, what
  is he here for? Must he be a drone? What is the privilege of moving worth to
  him? Citizens of other states may come here and become farmers, or lawyers,
  (that would be a poor business, said Mr E.) or doctors. They may, when here,
  said Mr E. do what citizens here may do, or the constitution is not worth a
  rush. ‘Twas claimed that blacks might come here and go to other schools. Might
  not the Legislature then say to them, and to all others, you shall send your
  children to the Presbyterian school—to the Baptist school, or to the Methodist
  school? Might not the Legislature further say, we do not like Roman Catholics,
  and we will therefore have no school where Catholics instruct? Gentlemen must
  go this length, who advocate this law. Would it be claimed that the fact of
  putting this power in the hands of the select men to exercise, made any
  difference? This was a mere parade of liberality—the select men of Canterbury
  would sooner shed their blood than grant Miss Crandall permission to keep this
  school. The power to license, said Mr E., is a power to deny—and we are to
  hold our most sacred rights and privileges at the pleasure of the select men;
  they can grant or they can prohibit.
</p>
<p>
  Mr E. now proceeded to consider the rights which citizens of each state are
  entitled to enjoy in the several states. He read from the opinion of Judge
  Washington, as reported in the 4
  <sup>th</sup>
  of Washington’s Circuit Court Reps. page 380, which he claimed showed
  conclusively that the new law of Connecticut was unconstitutional. He also
  maintained that the views he took of this law were supported by Judge Story,
  in the third volume of his recent work on the Constitution and also in
  Sergeant’s Constitutional law, page 385. The legislation of Congress on the
  subject of the Missouri question, he claimed distinctly recognized blacks as
  Citizens. The law when it says that no person shall keep a school for the
  instruction of blacks from abroad, says, in effect, that no foreign person
  shall come here and be taught—How were they to be taught without a teacher?
  This law would extinguish the light of knowledge—would degrade those who are
  now degraded, and depress those who are now depressed. It said to the naked,
  go unclothed, and to the hungry, go unfed. The distinctions which now existed
  on account of color were sufficiently great—the colored people had now
  difficulties enough to struggle with—he hoped they would not be increased.
</p>
<p>
  The general policy of this law, continued Mr E., and its connexion with the
  subject of slavery, though a question touching deep feelings, cannot, without
  impropriety, be discussed here. Had he been a member of the legislature that
  enacted it, he might have said something on the subject, but should refrain
  from it on the present occasion.
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, Mr. Ellsworth thanked the jury for the attention they had paid
  to his remarks, which, he said, were quite unsatisfactory to himself. He hoped
  they would see their way clear, before they found his client guilty of a crime
  for endeavoring to elevate and enlighten an unfortunate portion of our race.
  Were they prepared to say that teaching the word of God was a crime? That it
  was a crime to teach children the Bible? He left the case with them. He
  trusted that the court would tell them that the law was unconstitutional, but
  if they should not, my appeal, said Mr E., is to THE PEOPLE, and to THE PEOPLE
  I leave my client.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Strong said that after the very full, and eloquent, and conclusive
  argument of his brother Ellsworth, it would be more grateful to his feelings to
  leave the case in the hands of the jury without adding a word. He feared that
  he should rather diminish than add to the force of that argument. He however
  found an apology for occupying a short time, in the magnitude of the
  case under consideration. It involves the liberties of the people.
</p>
<p>
  Those who advocate the cause of the defendant, said Mr. S., are charged with
  endeavoring to nullify the laws. What is nullification? An attempt by the
  Legislature of a state, to destroy a power higher than itself. South Carolina
  had done this to the fullest extent—our own state had made some progress, but
  the right of trial by jury was still left us. A culprit is here arraigned—a
  female—by the courtesy of the court she had not been called upon to hold up
  her hand, and plead to the information against her, but she nevertheless stood
  there as a criminal. She was charged with giving instruction, but there was no
  pretence that she has inculcated bad principles. He had heard of a land where
  this might be criminal, but it was a land where despots reigned. Her crime
  consisted in this, that she had given light to those who were in mental
  darkness—had taught those who were ignorant, to read the bible. It was true
  that the persons to whom she had given instruction were descendants of that
  unfortunate race, who were even in a state of slavery in this country. He said
  this not to their reproach, but to our own. He rejoiced that public sentiment
  had changed on the subject—but one feeling now exists &amp; that was not
  peculiar to our own country. The Legislature of Great Britain was engaged in
  passing a law of a very different character from the one now in question, at
  the very time that our Legislature passed this. Even in a country where a king
  and nobles constituted one branch of the legislature, a law had been passed,
  almost simultaneously with our own, strikingly dissimilar in its provisions.
  We complained that this class of persons were low, degraded, and addicted to
  crime. Has God made them so, or have they been made so by ignorance? ‘Twas a
  little boon to give them liberty, and keep them in ignorance. Better to rivet
  the chains of slavery, then to break those and rivet again the chains of
  ignorance. But one sentiment now pervaded the people of this country, with
  respect to educating these people—there was a difference as to the way. Some
  were for colonizing them, others had different views, but all agreed they
  ought to be instructed in some way. If they were carried out of the country in
  ignorance, was it not carrying them away that they might destroy themselves.
  Unless education accompanied them all was in vain. What, asked Mr. S., has
  been the course pursued by the defendant? He rejoiced that her pupils had been
  before the jury, and that they had had opportunities of seeing them. Were they
  not worthy of being instructed? Had not the defendant entirely deferred to
  public sentiment, in relation to keeping the races separate? What more
  feasible course for educating these people could be point out, than the one
  she had adopted? The colored race could not educate themselves—unless some
  person would step forward and overcome these prejudices, whether rightful or
  not, he should not decide, they must ever live in ignorance.
</p>
<p>MR. STRONG, next proceeded to remark on the law.</p>
<p>
  He read the preamble and said it put him in mind of the painter, who affixed a
  label to his pictures, lest the spectators might not otherwise be able to
  determine what animal he intended to delineate. The question, continued Mr S.,
  is often asked, ""would you be willing to have a school of this description in
  your own neighborhood?” What if we should not, could we put it down by passing
  an unconstitutional law? What if I did not wish my neighbor to keep a large
  number of dogs, could I of course compel him to put them away? This law does
  not prevent colored persons from coming to this State. They may come and be
  idle, and welcome—they may come for any earthly purpose except education. That
  they are told they must get in the district schools. In these schools, the
  colored class sit on the lowest bench. They cannot go to these schools—as soon
  as their minds become a little expanded, they must retire from them. He wished
  to have an instance pointed out where any black had continued to attend, for
  any length of time, and derived benefit. It was impossible that such should be
  the case as things now were. What they desired was a school by themselves,
  where, and only where, they could acquire an education. They asked of us
  bread, but we gave them a stone—they asked a fish, but we gave them a
  scorpion—there was the sting of reproach in it. We place our foot on the
  black, and hold him down in the dust, and then complain that he does not grow
  to the perfect stature of a man. There was but one Academy in the State where
  they could be admitted at all, and this was by the munificence of a private
  individual—he alluded to the late Mr Bacon of Colchester. He should have
  supposed by the argument of the gentleman who opened the case for the
  prosecution, that the new act would open the doors [of] every academy and
  college in the State. The proviso in the law amounted to nothing—it might as
  well have provided that nothing in that act should be construed to prevent
  colored persons from holding all the Bank stock in the State. The act exposed
  one to penalties who should instruct a colored person, from another State, in
  a sabbath school. It compelled us to obtain a license to seek out the poor,
  the ignorant, the destitute, and the benighted.
</p>
<p>
  It is claimed, said Mr S., that the legislature have the power to regulate
  schools—be it so. He asked however to be pointed to an instance where the
  regulation depended on the character of the scholar. This law excluded those
  whom it pronounced bad. He would say, let all be instructed, particularly the
  bad that they might be made better. He spoke however with confidence, when he
  said, that no law had ever existed, in this State, to regulate private school.
  (Mr S. then read from some of the ancient statutes, regulating schools,
  appointing inspectors, &amp;c.) The legislature, continued Mr S., regulated
  these schools because they had established them, and they undoubtedly might do
  so. Was this power claimed in order to prevent bad principles from being
  taught? He did not perceive that the defendant had offended in this respect.
  There was nothing bad in teaching arithmetic, geography, grammar, and the
  bible. If this however was the object of the law, whom did it protect? Our own
  citizens? No—we might teach them every thing naughty that we chose, but were
  restrained from doing so to those who came from abroad. This, said Mr S., is
  really the most
  <em>diffusive</em>
  kind of benevolence I ever heard of. Most of our criminal laws, continued Mr
  S., gives the court some discretionary power in imposing punishment, in this
  law the penalty is fixed, if the law itself be not fixed—if it be not pierced
  by the spear which emanated from the constitution. All public officers are
  sworn to support the constitution of the United States, and if any law
  interferes with that, it must be disregarded—otherwise they would incur the
  guilt of perjury. Whether any of the jury had taken this oath, he knew not,
  nor was it material to his argument. The Constitution of the United States was
  the supreme law, and must be regarded by all citizens, whether public officers
  or not. He meant to speak with all respect of the opinion of the Court, and
  though in civil matters the jury were bound to take the law as given from the
  Bench, it was otherwise in criminal questions. Here the Court advise, and the
  jury decide.
</p>
<p>
  He intended no disrespect to the legislature which enacted this law, by the
  animadversions which he made concerning it. It was notorious that public
  feeling frequently exercised a strong influence in regard to the passage of
  laws. As an instance of this, he would refer to a law passed a few years since
  in this State, called the Steam-boat law. In this law, we cut off many of our
  privileges for the sake of retaliating on the State of New-York. The law was
  passed by acclamation. Gov. Wolcott sent a sensible well written message to
  the legislature, suggesting its impolicy and unconstitutionality, but it was
  no more regarded than if he had sent a page of the spelling book—it did not
  change a vote. The Dartmouth College case was another instance of the passage
  of a State law, in time of high excitement. Again and again had our sacred
  constitution been called to exert its conservative principle.
</p>
<p>
  Mr S. said that it was with some surprise that he had listened to the
  statement of the opening Counsel for the prosecution, as to the law of
  Pennsylvania, relating to the residence of blacks in their limits. What the
  gentleman asserted to be the law of that State, which he had so properly
  styled “the land of Penn,” was a bill reported to the legislature, but never
  passed into a law. Other bills had been framed and prepared to pass, in other
  legislatures, which Mr S. apprehended would form a miscellaneous collection.
  It would greatly gratify his curiosity, could he get a sight of some of them.
  It was no reflection on the character of our State, that under excitement, it
  had passed an unconstitutional law—other States had done the same. Mr S. here
  referred to the second section of the 4<sup>th</sup>
  Article of the constitution, on which he said he relied to prove the
  unconstitutionality of the law. He also read from the articles of
  confederation, which he claimed to contain a similar provision. By the
  adoption of the constitution, we were, said Mr S., made one people. ‘Twas
  necessary—‘twas the principle of the proclamation of Gen. Jackson, so
  deservedly popular throughout this section of the Country. If this principle
  was impugned, it destroyed that which alone made our government worth
  anything. (Mr. S. also read from Judge Story what had before been quoted by Mr
  Ellsworth) In ancient times, continued Mr S., it was a proud boast—“I am a
  Roman citizen.” A citizen of the United States was entitled to one no less
  proud—I am an American citizen. We were not to say that we were citizens of
  Connecticut, but that we were American citizens. A portion of our country men
  might wish to raise the Palmetto banner, but the eagle and the stripes were
  our badge. The attorney for the prosecution would improve upon the
  Nullification of South Carolina. That State had only to pass an act excluding
  the standing army o the United States from her territory, and the principles
  of the old General’s proclamation were all nullified, or Mr S. was greatly
  mistaken. Were blacks citizens? The term “citizen” was to have a technical
  sense. He had listened with pleasure to this remark from the gentleman who
  opened the case, for when a word has a technical signification, it was always
  easy to get its precise meaning. All the technics however which seemed to
  attach to the word were that a citizen must not be colored. If colored persons
  were not citizens, Mr S. claimed that they were not inhabitants, which
  conclusion was manifestly absurd. Color had no connection with the question of
  citizenship by birth, though it had in respect to naturalization. In deference
  to southern views, the Militia laws of the nation, passed in 1792, did not
  include colored persons—the words were, “every free white male citizen”—was
  not this an express recognition that persons other than whites were citizens?
  If “citizens” meant a white person only, why was this language used? (Mr S.
  here read from Ingersoll’s digest 745, relative to the protections granted to
  American seamen, which, he said were always given to blacks as well as
  whites.) The war of 1812 was caused, continued Mr S., in no small degree, by
  the impressment of our seamen who had these protections in their pockets. Our
  government considered the impressment of blacks who had these protections, as
  standing on the same ground with the impressment of the whites, and the war
  was declared and fought as much on their account as on account of the whites.
  The law in relation to American shipping required that in order to be entitled
  to discriminating duties at the custom house, it must be owned in whole or in
  part, by American Citizens. Colored persons frequently owned ships which were
  uniformly regarded as the property of American citizens.
</p>
<p>Mr S. named Paul Cuffee as an instance.</p>
<p>
  The courts of the United States were open to citizens and also to
  aliens—aliens, however, must describe themselves as such, in order to maintain
  an action. The uniform practice was for blacks to sue as citizens, never as
  aliens. Mr S. here read from Kent’s Com. and claimed from the doctrine there
  advanced that a black might go from one State to another, and enjoy in that
  other, the same privileges that a person of the same class enjoyed who
  belonged to that other State, I do not claim, said Mr S., that a citizen of an
  other State coming into this State, brings all privileges with him which he
  before enjoyed—he brings with him however the character of a citizen of the
  United States, and that entitles him to enjoy here, the same privileges with
  our citizens under circumstances similar to his own.
</p>
<p>
  Gen. Jackson, said Mr S., in his proclamation at New Orleans, addressed the
  blacks as “fellow citizens.” Did he mean to insult them? No, he meant to
  recognize them as citizens and the law so recognized them. They could purchase
  and hold real estate, could gain a settlement, and could, in fact, do what
  citizen[s] could, and what aliens could not do. It would be an insult to talk
  of naturalizing a man born here. The constitution of our State had been
  alluded to, in order to prove that blacks were not citizens, because it did
  not allow them to vote. Voting was not test of citizenship. If it was then by
  the showing of the gentleman, blacks were citizens, for in New York they were
  allowed to vote, and were therefore, according to the gentleman, citizens of
  the United States in New York; of course they were citizens here.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Strong here replied to the arguments which had been drawn from the course
  of legislation pursued by other States in respect to the blacks—the law of
  Ohio, &amp;c. He read the law of Louisiana, which affixed a penalty of $500 or
  the first offence of instruct[ing] a black in the Sabbath Schools, death for
  the second. The jury, he said, were not to regard the laws of other States as
  necessarily giving the true construction to the Constitution.—These laws, if
  unconstitutional, did not support our law, and it was their province to decide
  their constitutionality. He also referred to a late opinion of Judge Baldwin,
  given in the Circuit Court of the United States, and also to the opinion of
  Judge Washington before referred to, with respect to the rights of citizens of
  the U. States in the several states.
</p>
<p>
  Our ancient law, said Mr. S., which allowed persons to be carried out of the
  State, who were not citizens, was restrained from operating on apprentices,
  because they came for the acquisition of knowledge.—While minors were
  prevented from contracting for any thing but necessaries, they were allowed in
  express terms, to contract for the purpose of education.—Was education, he
  asked, a fundamental right? Ferdinand of Spain, he presumed did not believe
  that it was, neither did that king who was now chased through Portugal—and
  why? because education was the basis of liberty. Should such however be the
  doctrine of this free land? If our law had said that blacks in this state
  should not be educated at all, though inhuman and unchristian, it would not be
  liable to the same objections that it now is. The case seemed to him as plain
  as any he had ever submitted to a jury. The conclusion followed on the heel of
  the premises. If a school was opened to blacks who belonged to this state, it
  was certain it must be open to those who came from other states, under the
  same circumstances, for by the Constitution of the United States, they were
  entitled to a community of rights.
</p>
<p>
  As it regarded the license, which, under this law, might be obtained of the
  select men and civil authority, ‘twas nothing at all—it would not be given,
  but, if it would, we were not bound to ask it. As well might we be told that
  we should not eat without their permission. That would merely starve the
  body—this starved the mind—it kept on husks that which confer[s] on man his
  immortality.
</p>
<p>
  It was claimed that we had other laws of a similar character. ‘Twas no
  matter—it made this law no better—doing wrong once was no apology for doing it
  again, much less did it create a right to do it. Make the law equal as to its
  application and he would find no fault.
</p>
<p>
  He took the case of Eliza Glasko—she was an inhabitant of the state, and Ann
  Eliza Hammond was not. What difference could the Legislature make in relation
  to these persons as to the right to attend what school they chose? As to the
  law requiring citizens of other states to give bonds before they could
  maintain an action in our Courts, it operated equally—citizens of our state,
  if they resided out, were subject to the law—it depended simply on residence.
  The law providing against the settlement of paupers would not sustain this
  law. That required bonds for the support of those likely to become chargeable.
  Bonds were not sought here, except the bonds which tie the mind, and fetter
  the man—not bonds of security, but bonds of vassalage. It cannot, said Mr S.
  be sustained. The people would not endure the alien law of ‘98—‘twas abhorrent
  to the principles of our government, and drove from power the man that made
  it. This law has features even more odious than that. The people will not and
  ought not to endure it. By sanctioning this law, he said the jury would
  sanction a principle which would prevent them or their sons from emigrating to
  the western states.
</p>
<p>
  He trusted he need spend no more time—he believed they would do their duty. He
  should ask the court to charge them that the law was obnoxious to the charges
  he has made against it, but should the court do otherwise, his appeal was to
  them. It was their prerogative to pass upon this law which owed its creation
  to an excited state of feeling. To them he looked for a verdict which would
  maintain civil liberty.
</p>
<p>
  Mr WELCH regretted the duty that had devolved upon him [in] his state of health,*
  and his recent connexion with the case, would, he said, perhaps prevent him
  from doing to the case even that justice which might have been in his
  power to do under other circumstances. Besides the eloquence and ingenuity of
  the defendant’s counsel might have diverted the mind of the jury from the real
  issue. He should discharge his duty without personal feeling. If he had before
  harbored any, he should strive to banish it from his mind now. He wished the
  right of the state of Connecticut to be fairly, impartially, and
  dispassionately examined. The government asked no conviction but upon
  principles which could be consistently reconciled with justice and the
  constitution. The fact that the defendant was a female had been alluded to,
  but this altered not her rights. She had the same and none other rights, than
  every citizen. Her hoped the jury would not be misled by the impassioned
  flashes of eloquence which they had heard from her counsel. He would have them
  pause and examine. The rights of the judge and the beggar were the same at the
  bar of justice. Rights there, were common, but artificial rights in society
  were different. The rights of citizens had been pressed upon their
  attention—the rights of states must not be forgotten.
</p>
<p>
  Was the law Constitutional? Possibly it was not. Laws has been passed which
  undoubtedly were unconstitutional, and if this was, he asked no conviction
  under it. They had but one course to pursue. If the law was contrary to the
  constitution they were bound to acquit—no one, if such was the character of
  the law, would acquiesce in the decision more cheerfully than himself. The
  gentlemen opposed to him has said, very emphatically, that they appealed to
  the people if the court decided the law to be constitutional. The jury, he
  said, were the people. It was no doubt true that in criminal cases the jury
  could decide [thus] in spite of the court, but, was it enviable? Would they
  desire to do it? Rights were at stake, the rights of the state as well as the
  rights of the party.—He would have the jury look at the result of their
  verdict as it respected the effects it would have on these rights. They might
  take the law into their own hands and acquit the defendant. They sacrificed
  the rights of the state beyond remedy by doing so—their verdict against the
  state was final. If, however, they found a verdict against the defendant, it
  had no such effect on her. The case could be carried to another tribunal where
  she could have perfect justice, and where her rights would not be at all
  prejudiced by a conviction here. ‘Twas no hardship to her, and a contrary
  course might do an irremediable wrong to the state.
</p>
<p>
  They had been told that they had, that day, to decide a great question—an
  exciting one. It was true. Why then had they been called so loudly to take the
  case from the court? If they decided the law to be unconstitutional ‘twould be
  no evidence except between the same parties as a matter of fact. Another jury
  might decide the law to be constitutional, and thus what was a crime at one
  time would be no crime at another, though tried under the same law. He had no
  idea that they had any motive but to discharge impartially their duties as
  jurors.
</p>
<p>
  Mr W. said, that as the defendant, by her plea, had put all the facts
  necessary to her conviction in issue, he should now examine the proof. The
  counsel for the defence had seemed tacitly to admit the facts charged to be
  true, but as he did not mean to desert any part of the case which the
  gentlemen opposed to him had not distinctly admitted to be in favor of the
  prosecution, he should recapitulate the evidence, and see if a case had been
  made out. (Mr W. here examined the testimony, commented upon it at length, and
  claimed that it was perfectly conclusive.)
</p>
<p>
  The gentlemen who had argued for the defence, said Mr W., never meant to make
  the constitutionality of this law a point in the case. They thought they had
  thrown a barrier around their client by closing the mouths of witnesses. It
  was the object of the gentlemen to go out of court in triumph for want of
  proof to convict, but the grating doors of a certain building, though it did
  not unstop deaf ears, did open dumb mouths. The witnesses then spoke,
  notwithstanding the gentlemen had hoped to apply to them the gag law. Their
  efforts had proved ineffectual—their flag was furled, and when he saw the
  quivering step of a retreating army he believed that they anticipated defeat.
</p>
<p>
  Mr W. rejoiced that a spirit was going abroad to improve the colored race.
  ‘Twas one thing however to produce a reformation by proper and legal means and
  another by improper and illegal ones. He would refrain no longer from
  considering the constitutional question in the case. The law was called
  unconstitutional because it was said to prohibit free persons of color from
  coming into this state, from other states, to be educated. Mr W. said that he
  knew no better way of testing constitutionality of a law, than a comparison of
  the law with the provisions of the constitution. Whenever they came in
  collision, it was easy to decide which must stand.—By this test then, by a
  comparison of the letter of the law with the letter of the constitution, he
  perceived no discrepancy. (Mr W. here read the second section of the fourth
  article of the constitution and then read the law.) Now, continued Mr W. this
  law does not prohibit any one from coming here for any purpose, if permission
  be obtained. If it is on the prohibition that gentlemen claim the law to be
  unconstitutional. But if permission be granted in all cases when asked, as
  possibly it may be, where is the unconstitutionality of the law? The gentlemen
  claim that it is prohibitory and therefore unconstitutional—it may never be
  prohibitory; how then is it unconstitutional? In order, gentlemen, said Mr W.,
  to determine that this law is unconstitutional, you must look through the
  vista of coming time, and with a keen prophetic vision, foresee that the civil
  authority will never grant their license. You must settle a question of face
  which you cannot settle. If you can find this fact, put it in your
  verdict—render this libel on your understandings along with it—such a
  principle as this ought not to be contended for—the tears of contrition should
  blot it out, and the blush of shame should light a fire to consume it.
</p>
<p>
  In respect to the meaning of the term “citizen” in the constitution, Mr. W.
  claimed that the ground taken by Mr. Judson, in opening the case, was
  tenable—that the term was used in a technical sense. He denied that it meant
  all persons who lived and moved within certain limits, as he understood the
  gentleman to claim. (Mr. W. here read from the articles of confederation, to
  support his construction of the term “citizen.”) He said that his brother
  Strong had read this quotation of a long trot, as though he feared the jury
  would understand it, and perceive the fallacy of his argument. Mr W. claimed
  that there was a distinction between the term “people” or “inhabitants,” in
  the article of confederation, and the term “citizens” in the constitution. He
  also read from Dr. Webster’s dictionary the definition of “citizen,” and
  insisted that blacks do not come within it.—Mr. W. also read and commented on
  the subject of naturalization, and claimed that Congress had never treated
  blacks as capable of becoming citizens. It was not the policy of the
  government. The Missouri question had been alluded to, but the whole of it was
  one continued act of political juggling—he should not think of appealing to it
  as authority for any thing.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. W. said that he derived a strong argument in construction which he gave
  the constitution from the usages and legislation of other states. He then went
  on to remark at length upon the statutes of many of the states, in relation to
  the black population. If blacks were citizens he said the legislatures of many
  of the states must be called worse than Turkish tyrants—He dwelt with much
  emphasis and ability on the laws of Massachusetts and Rhode Island,
  prohibiting the intermarriage of whites and blacks. These laws said Mr. W.,
  could only be reconciled with the constitution on the ground that blacks were
  not citizens. The right of education had been called a fundamental right. He
  was not disposed to contest the truth of this position. The right of selecting
  the partner of one’s joys and sorrows was however a right no less dear, no
  less sacred, than the right of selecting those whom we will have to educate
  our children. If our law was unconstitutional it was clear that all these laws
  to which he had alluded were also unconstitutional. He did not believe they
  were—the fact that they had been acquiesced in so long was evidence conclusive
  to his mind that they were not.
</p>
<p>
  The case had been so fully gone into by his associate who opened the case,
  that he would not detain the jury longer. He put the rights of the state into
  their hands, and also the rights of the defendant, under direction of the
  court as to the law. They were not to inquire whether their verdict would
  advance the power of one party of another—whether it would feed or allay the
  excitement which existed. They should forget all that did not legitimately
  belong to the case—even the eloquence of the gentleman wo had argued for the
  defence should be forgotten, so far as it was not relevant. Duties were
  theirs—consequences devolved elsewhere.
</p>
<p>His Honor Judge EATON then charged the jury in substance as follows.</p>
<p><em>Gentlemen of the Jury:</em></p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prudence
  Crandall is charged in the information before you, with a violation of a
  certain statute law of this state, forbidding the setting up of a school for
  the instruction of colored persons, not inhabitants of this state, or boarding
  or harboring them for the purpose of instruction. Provided the acts charged
  are proved to be done, the day is not material, if since the passage of the
  law, and before the filing of the information. Neither are the names nor the
  number of the persons instructed material. The facts must be proved to your
  satisfaction, gentlemen, and whether they are so or not you are the sole
  judges—it is not the duty of the court even to advise in relation to the
  measure of proof.
</p>
<p>
  As to the law of the case, this also belongs to you to decide, but the Court
  has a duty to perform with regard to it. That duty is, to advise you as to its
  validity and constitutionality. It has been claimed at the Bar that the law is
  unconstitutional, and that the state legislature had no power to pass it. It
  is gratifying to the court, gentlemen, that its opinion is not final—that it
  can be revised by a higher tribunal, and corrected if erroneous. The opinion
  of the Court is, that the law is constitutional and obligatory on the people
  of this state.—You will take the case into consideration, gentlemen, and
  render a verdict of guilty or not guilty, as to you shall seem just and
  proper.
</p>
<p>
  The jury retired, and after an absence of several hours, returned into Court
  not having agreed on a verdict. They were again ordered out, and again
  returned not having agreed. The third time they stated to the court that there
  was no probability that they should ever agree. The court then discharged
  them. This operates as a continuance of the case to the next term of the
  County Court to be holden on the second Tuesday of December
  next.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
  Mr. Editor. It is truly astonishing to witness the efforts at
  misrepresentation in the last Advertiser respecting Miss Crandall’s trial.—It
  is the part of wisdom in the many correspondents to that paper that they have
  not signed their names to the articles communicated. An article appears headed
  thus, “Effects of abolition principles in a Court of Justice.” The writer
  attempts, in his way, to question the veracity of persons who were called upon
  to testify, when they said that they had drank tea with Miss Crandall and her
  scholars but could not recollect the countenances of any who were then in
  court. From this circumstance the writer wishes to convey the idea to his
  readers that they were guilty of swearing falsely, and thus were it in his
  power, would he fix upon them the seal of infamy. The writer of that article
  should know, that however much honorable men may differ from him in sentiment,
  merely a difference of opinion does not render them incapable of speaking the
  truth, and whenever he touches upon an honorable man’s character, he touches a
  very tender spot. However lightly he may regard it,—character, in the
  estimation of some men—some abolitionists we trust—ay, even some who have had
  the hardihood to
  <em>sit at the same table</em>
  with Miss Crandall and her colored misses—is above all price. The writer
  thinks it is a most incredible circumstance that a person could drink tea with
  20 misses whom he never saw before, and 2 or 3 months afterwards, when he
  should see misses in a public assembly, could not recollect that they were the
  persons with whom he drank tea. Perhaps they were present at the table, and
  perhaps they were not. But suppose they were—would it be any thing strange for
  a
  <em>gentleman</em>
  to sit down at table with 20 misses, half of them perhaps, sitting in a direct
  line with himself, (so that it would be extremely difficult for him to see
  them) and not seeing their countenances so as immediately to recollect them
  when seen a number of weeks afterwards, with their bonnets on—in a different
  attire—in a “court of Justice?” Surely these gentlemen—as they said they could
  not recollect them—must be set down as liars, for no one can doubt—considering
  the circumstances—that there was a
  <em>reasonable possibility</em>
  of their not knowing them at a glance—whether they were there or not. We would
  advise the writer of that article to look up much reckless villains and have
  them tried for perjury.

  “Philosophy, though eagle-eyed in nature’s tendencies” has not succeeded in
  drawing a line of discrimination between the members of the human family, so
  marked as to proscribe from the commonwealth of humanity those who Cowper says
  are “guilty of a skin not colored like his own.” Indeed if my complexion does
  afford proof that I am not so nobly born, not endowed with the same
  unalienable privileges and rights as those of a different color, I declare
  that I am not ambitious of attaining their prerogatives, by changing skins
  with any of them—and much less do I repine at the decrees of Him who has made
  of one blood all the nations of the earth.

<p>
  Though in the New-England States color is not deemed a sufficient offence to
  consign the limbs of the tawny inhabitant to the shackle, and his back to the
  scourge, yet the prejudices of the South are not wholly unfelt in the North;
  although the fetter falls from the limb of the African, when his foot touches
  the New England soil, still there lingers about the heart of a yankee some of
  that bitterness and contempt towards his colored brethren, which forged
  galling chains for that oppressed race.
</p>
<p>
  Many specious arguments have been advanced to prove the justness of African
  Slavery, and although many honest men have met and refuted them, others have
  allowed themselves to be wheedled into the comfortable idea, that they are
  made of better clay, and entitled to more consideration, than their degraded
  sufferers. Let me call upon
  <em>you</em>
  , who have still a small proportion of humanity left in your bosoms, to start
  from the siren flaterers, who would lull you to repose, while thousand of your
  fellow creatures groan beneath the lash of unfeeling tyrants, under the flag
  of a nation professing to be guided by the law of Liberty, and Equal Rights!
  Have you not professed to the world, that “ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL.”
  Is not this mockery? Are not these very letters shaded by the crimson blood of
  your suffering brethren? Or
  <em>are not</em>
  Africans men? Tyrant, does not your bleeding slave while kneeling to you for
  mercy, address you in the language of human nature—and do not
  <em>you</em>
  prove yourself incapable of appreciating that language? ‘Tis
  <em>you</em>
  who seem less than a man, and most devoid of every principle, every attribute
  of humanity.
</p>
<p>
  One miserable refuge, behind which the slave-holder retreats, is this; that
  many slaves are very well satisfied with their situation and would not wish to
  change it!” Very fine indeed! Because you have reduced them to this abject
  dependence, and perverted all the noble independence of their nature, you have
  a right to trample upon their undeniable rights, and continue the iniquitous
  business! Because a blind man loves the taste of arsenic, (being ignorant of
  its deadly tendency) you will thrust it down his throat! From what must that
  contentedness arise, which induces the slave to embrace the scourge and hub
  the fetter. Would
  <em>you</em>
  be content to drudge for a master, and crouch at his feet like a dog? You say
  “death before slavery,” and you would despise a white man who would submit to
  the degradation of unlimited subordination. Because a wretch who is weary of
  life requests you to shoot him, would you be justified in blowing his brains
  out with a pistol? Answer these questions ye advocates for slavery, and if
  “custom has not steeled your hearts” to every principle of rectitude, you will
  see that mercy to a negro entitles you to no praise, since he has the same
  claim to liberty and respect as a European.

<p align=""right"">CATO.</p>
"	Black male writer	This letter represents the most mportant local Black male voice in the pages of <em>The Unionist</em>. As was the case in the trial transcripts, a Black history lesson is embedded in the frequent use of "Cato" as a pen name. During the time of the American Revolution, the white founding fathers specifically wanted to shape the new government like that of the Roman Republic, not the Roman Empire. Hence they preferred the mythos of Cato - exemplifying moral courage and integrity - to that of Caesar's power grab. African-Americans, of course, found the white emphasis on liberty both puzzling - given the continued presence of slavery - and an opportunity to use this now-public rhetoric. Thus, as you can see in the illustration accompanying this entry, one of the most famous African-American petitions of the Revolutionary era came from "Cato" - a poor Black whose emancipation was in danger from an attempt to repeal a law granting liberty. Written in 1781, Cato's petition was well-known in the Black community.	William Cowper

<p>
  MR EDITOR,—I was pleased to notice the account of the “training” which
  appeared in your columns of last week. I have often wondered that a system so
  useless—(to say nothing of its pernicious influence on public morals) and so
  evidently unpopular among the people should so generally have escaped the
  censure of the press.
</p>
<p>
  The evils attendant on the training system are great—
  <em>they are felt in this community,</em>
  and ought to be exposed by every friend of justice and by every lover of good
  order in society.—I rejoice to perceive that you understand the best mode of
  treating the subject. Sound and sober argument will have no influence with
  those who advocate the present miserable system of militia trainings. Ridicule
  has done more to bring about a reform in this system than all the arguments
  that have ever been urged against it.
</p>
<p>
  As it is the professed object of your paper to promote the cause of justice
  and of sound morals it is to be hoped you will not let this subject drop. You
  will be sustained by this community, and by exposing the unequal operations of
  the militia law, its uselessness, &amp; its pernicious consequences, you will
  merit and receive the thanks of the
  people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"	It is significant that the letter writers all have to use pseudonmys. Not an uncommon practice, but potentially indicates community hostility.	This letter from "W." concerns militia training laws. Apparently a critique of these militia training laws had been included in <em>The Unionist</em> issue of August 29, 1833 (1:5). This now-missing article also included a critique of the "spirit-stirring-drum." These ideas are congruent with Jonathan Dymond's anti-war writings.
Charles Burleigh's commentary on the First Trial	The Unionist	Black Law; Prudence Crandall; Journalistic Debate	"We are told in the last Advertiser, that the counsel for Miss Crandall in the
recent trial, “spoke like men who were paid for it,” but that Messrs. Judson and
Welch “spoke
<em>“con amore.”</em>
If Messrs. Ellsworth and Strong argue so powerfully and conclusively merely for
pay, what, we may well ask,
<em>would they do</em>
if they should speak
<em>“con amore.</em>
” We have no wish to underrate the merits of the counsel for the prosecution; we
doubt not they did their best. The gentleman who closed we would allude to in
particular as having displayed ability and ingenuity worthy of a better cause.
True we could not but think he in some instances approached nearer to coarsness
[sic] and vulgarity than was altogether seemly under existing circumstances, but
considering he was “trammeled by a bad cause,” he certainly acquitted himself
very creditably. But were we desirous of eulogizing him and his colleague, we
would not accuse them of arguing such a cause

elegance of language unusual even to themselves.”

Character of the Dutch	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler	"<em>Character of the Dutch,</em>
—It is well known that a habit prevails almost every where, of underrating and disparaging Dutch character and Dutchmen. Nothing is more unjust, and nothing is
more common—nothing testifies more unequivocally the ignorance and prejudice of
those who indulge in it, than the habit.—England is called the mother; but if
such of our population, whose ancestors emigrated from her shores are proud of
their origin, much more reason have they, who are descendants of the honest
burgomasters of Holland, to be proud of theirs.—Holland, though occupying a
territory not larger than the state of Maryland, was first among the nations of
Europe to take a stand in favor of liberty, and, single handed, maintained a six
years’ war in its defence, against the greatest odds. At a time when France and
England were yet involved in bigotry and superstition, Holland achieved for
herself civil and religious freedom, and opened her bosom as an asylum for the
oppressed Huguenots; while others, the pilgrim fathers sought a refuge from
persecution in the wilds of America. Holland for a long time took the lead of
all the surrounding nations in commerce, in science, in arts, and in arms. For
the inventions of the telescope, microscope, thermometer, pendulum, gunpowder,
and printing, the world is indebted to the Dutch. And the best and most correct
translation of the original Scriptures, in any language, is that of the Low
Dutch, made under the auspices of the Synod of Dort.
"		In what could be a sly parallel to racial prejudice, the historic contributions of the Dutch are positively evaluated. The Synod of Dort was the Calvinistic theological gathering that cemented the TULIP doctrine of total human depravity.
Kidnapping	The Unionist	Race; Abolition	"<em>Kidnapping.</em>
—A man of color, named John Hill, was brought before the police magistrate on
Monday, charged with abduction, in taking away Sarah Jane Demons, a girl of
color, aged six years, from the house of Emilia Smith, a woman of color, who
resides at 99 Greenwich st. On Sunday evening three gentlemen observed the
prisoner carrying a child, which was crying, and seemed very reluctant to be
taken away. The gentlemen stopped Hill, and questioned him as to how he came in
possession of the child. He gave them evasive answers, and they then inquired of
the child where she lived. The little girl told them her place of residence, and
signified her entire ignorance of the cause for which Hill had taken her away.
The gentlemen considered the case sufficiently suspicious to warrant them in
arresting the prisoner, and one of them, assisted by a man of color, named
Bristol Martin, lodged him in prison, whilst the other restored the little girl
to her friends. Hill’s explanation of the affair was, that he merely took the
child to <em>give it some candy</em>. He had been seen the same evening endeavoring to take away another child, who,
however, struggled so hard as to make him abandon his design. The occurrence
created considerable excitement amongst the people of color in the city, a large
number of whom attended to hear the case disposed of. Hill was committed to
prison.—

  language in Pegu and Cochin China. And above all we rejoice to know that some

  —A writer in the Boston Daily Advertiser, who is evidently familiar with

  is no local Bank strong enough to take them, burthened as such a duty is with
  the obligation, on the part of such local Bank, to receive the bills of all
  the branches of the Bank of the United States and to pay out Gold and Silver,
  for the checks of the Government.” It is also stated that the proposed removal
  is illegal, and not within the power of the Executive.

<p>The New York Commercial Advertiser contains the following paragraph:—</p>
<p>
  “Of one thing we feel very strongly assured, and we wish well what we say. No
  matter what terms or conditions are offered by the local banks—
  <em>the deposits will not be removed.</em>

Tin Roofs	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler	"<em>Tin Roofs.</em>
—The N.Y. Journal of Commerce informs us, that the practice of covering roofs
with tin instead of slate, is becoming quite extensive in that city. It is
estimated that no less than 300 have been thus covered [in] the present season.
In consequence of the removal of the 15 per cent, it is stated that tin is a
cheaper covering than slate. There is a considerable saving in timber and labor
in the construction of the roofs, as the tinned roofs are in general nearly
flat. Tin, it is said, is more durable than slate, and less liable to get out of
place or to be blown off by the wind.

—A traveller [sic] says, that during his long residence at Malta, and constant

hucksters to leave their fowls, eggs, butter, &amp;c. in baskets with the prices
fixed, and to return in&nbsp; the evening in perfect security of finding the
article as they left it or the exact price deposited in the place of just so
much as had found a purchaser.

The Americans, by an American	The Unionist	Miscellaneous Filler; National News	"<em>The Americans, by an American.</em>
—“The Rev. Calvin Colton has written a book entitled ‘The Americans,’ in which
he gives a deserved castigation to Capt. Basil Hall, Mrs. Trollope, and the
English Reviewers. This work, which is said to be a very clever performance,
coming on the back of Mr. Stuart’s, will pretty well settle the question with
these traducers of American character and manners.
"		This book, <em>The Americans, by an American in London</em>, by Calvin Colton (1789-1857), can be found in a [Hathitrust digitization.] (https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002007679153&view=1up&seq=7&q1=american%20colonization%20society)  It is unlikely that Burleigh had read it, as it contains support for the American Colonization Society, which he would not have endorsed.  In this 1833 book, Colton sees both the impracticality of the American Colonization Society's project, and the evil of slavery, but still thinks that the Colonization Society is a benevolent organization that is gradually raising consciousness around the issue of slavery. When he returned to the United States in 1835, though, he became a strident anti-abolitionist, even writing a piece titled <em>Abolition, a Sedition</em> in 1839.

Miss Crandall's Second Trial	The Unionist	Black Law; Prudence Crandall; Canterbury Female Academy; African-American Students	"<p>From the Brooklyn Unionist, October 10</p>
<p>MISS CRANDALL’S SECOND TRIAL.</p>
<p>
  Last Thursday Miss Crandall was brought before the Superior Court sitting in
  this place, (Judge Daggett on the bench,) upon an information similar to that
  on which she was tried at the last session of the County Court. She had been
  bound over to answer to two complaints, one for teaching, and the other for
  boarding colored persons from other states., but was tried on the former only.
  A.T. Judson, Esq. and C.F. Cleaveland, the State’s Attorney, conducted the
  prosecution, Henry Strong, Esq. and Hon. Calvin Goddard the defence. The plea
  as on the former trial was <em>not guilty.</em>
  Several witnesses were examined, the facts necessary to conviction were
  proved, and nothing remained but to establish the constitutionality of the
  law.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Judson opened the case for the prosecution and pursued much the same train
  of argument as on the former trial, except that in addition to the points then
  made, he contended that the clause in the constitution which was made the
  ground of the defence, was intended as a rule of action to the general
  government only, and not to the State Legislatures. He was followed by Mr.
  Strong, who, in a powerful, logical and conclusive argument, clearly exhibited
  the unconstitutionality of the law, showing that the Constitution
  <em>was</em> made to control the action of the state Legislatures; that it was intended to
  secure to all citizens of the United States, the enjoyment of such privileges
  and immunities as are fundamental; that the privilege of obtaining an
  education is fundamental; and that free blacks are citizens, and of course
  entitled, though citizens of other states, to the same privileges as our own
  colored population, and among others to that of acquiring knowledge here. Mr.
  Goddard closed for the defence, briefly but eloquently, and the State’s
  Attorney having concluded on the part of the prosecution, the judge rose and
  saying a few words respecting the importance of the question, and his
  inability to do it justice, declined giving his charge till the next morning.
</p>
<p>
  On Friday morning as soon as the court was opened every seat was occupied and
  many persons stood unable to obtain seats, all listening with profound
  attention to the charge. It occupied as nearly as we could estimate, about an
  hour, and as will be seen by the outline given below was decidedly in favor of
  the constitutionality of the law.
</p>
<p>
  After stating to the Jury the charge on which Miss Crandall was brought before
  them, His Honor Judge Daggett proceeded: “In relation to the facts there does
  not appear to be much controversy—it is your province however to decide
  whether they have been proved. It is also your province to decide as to the
  law, the court cannot direct you as to either. But it is the duty of the court
  to advise you in respect to the law.
</p>
<p>
  It is claimed that the law under which this prosecution is instituted, is
  unconstitutional. If it be, it is because it violates the constitution
  of the United States, for it is not violation of the constitution of
  Connecticut. The question then is, Does this law violate the constitution of
  the United States? If a law is clearly unconstitutional, it is the duty of the
  humblest court in the land, even a justice of the peace, so to pronounce it,
  for all judges, under which name are included jurors when acting as judges,
  are bound by the constitution or laws in the respective states to the contrary
  notwithstanding.
</p>
<p>
  In considering the question, “Is this law unconstitutional,” you will lay out
  of consideration all extrinsic matter, slavery, and all its enormous evils;
  the degradation of the blacks, and the utility and necessity of their being
  educated, except so far as it is necessary to determine whether the privilege
  of education is fundamental, of which I have no doubt.
</p>
<p>There are two points to be considered.</p>
<p>
  1
  <sup>st</sup>
  . The constitution secures to all citizens of the U.S. the privileges and
  immunities of citizens in the several states. The construction of this section
  <em>is not,</em>
  as was contended at the bar, that it regulates only the action of the general
  Government: it is operative as well upon the state Legislature as upon
  Congress.
</p>
<p>
  2
  <sup>nd</sup>
  . Are the persons affected by this law, citizens of the United States. The law
  prohibits colored persons from Havana coming here, as well as the blacks of
  other states. With respect to the former, the right of exclusion is
  unquestionable, for they are not citizens of the United States. Are the
  colored inhabitants of this country citizens? It is the opinion of this court
  that they are not. Are slaves citizens of the United States? The constitution
  recognizes them only as the basis of representation and taxation. I refer to
  the definition of the word citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the ablest
  philologist of this or any country. (The judge here read the several
  definitions of the word as given in Webster’s dictionary, the last of which,
  and the only one applicable to the case is as follows—“In the United States, a
  person, native or naturalized, who has the privilege of exercising the
  elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding real estate.”) Slaves, then,
  are not citizens, in any of the state constitutions. Are Indians citizens? It
  is difficult to say what they are, but they are not citizens. Kent, in his
  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct tribes, living under the protection
  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free people of color citizens? I
  answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution of the United States,
  or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of any of the states. In
  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis of representation, there
  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if they were so considered.
  But that makes free
  <em>persons</em>
  (adding three fifths of all other persons,) the basis of representation and
  taxation..
</p>
<p>
  It has been said that free blacks own vessels which participate in the
  peculiar privileges of American shipping. But this claim has never been
  settled by judicial decisions. I know of no case where this question has been
  settled. It is said also that blacks may sue in the U.S. Courts, but this too,
  has never, within my knowledge been decided. It is claimed that they are
  citizens because they may be guilty of treason, but so may any person who
  resides under the government and enjoys its protection, if he rises up against
  it.
</p>
<p>
  [His honor then read from Kent’s commentaries II, 210 a note in which the
  commentator speaks of the degraded condition of the blacks and the
  disabilities under which they labor, and thence inferred that in Kent’s
  opinion they were not citizens.]
</p>
<p>
  Another reason for believing that people of color were not considered
  citizens, is found in the fact that when the United States Constitution was
  adopted every state except Massachusetts, tolerated slavery. The slave laws of
  New-York were as severe as those of any state in the Union. In 1740 a slave in
  that state was convicted by three justices and jury of five, and burnt at the
  stake. God forbid that I should add to the degradation of this people, by
  stating these things, but such is our condition.
</p>
<p>
  But if free blacks are citizens I am not prepared to say that the law is
  <em>unconstitutional,</em> though on this point I have more doubts than on the other. The constitution of
  the United States did not profess to vest in the State Legislatures any new
  powers, but to abridge those already possessed. I see not but the Legislature,
  under their general power, might pass this law, I say nothing of its justice
  or injustice, for I do not stand here to justify or abuse the legislature
  which passed it. If the people disapprove the law, let them choose better men
  to represent them who will repeal it. The privilege of acquiring an education
  is certainly a fundamental privilege, but I am of opinion that the Legislature
  may regulate it.
</p>

  The jury went out, and after an absence of 20 or 30 minutes returned with a
  verdict of GUILTY.

  be carried to the Supreme Court of Errors, which will sit here next July.”

</p>
<p>
  On this singular decision we remark that if the case be so that free colored
  people are not citizens of the United States, their condition is far worse
  than we had supposed. But we cannot believe this, the arguments in the decision
  notwithstanding; and we cannot account for it that such a decision comes from
  Judge Daggett, except on the supposition that strong feeling, excited in his
  native place (New Haven), by an attempt to erect a similar school there some
  time ago, has biased his judgment.
</p>
<p>Judge Daggett says</p>
<p>
  ‘Are the colored inhabitants of this country citizens? It is the opinion of
  this court that they are not. Are slaves citizens of the U.S.? The
  constitution recognizes them only as the basis of representation and taxation.
  I refer to the definition of the word citizen as given by Mr. Webster, the
  ablest philologist of this or any country. (The judge here read the several
  definitions of the word as given in Webster’s dictionary, the last of which,
  and the only one applicable to the case is as follows—“In the United States, a
  person, native or naturalized, who has the privilege of exercising the
  elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding real estate.”) Slaves, then,
  are not citizens, in any of the state constitutions. Are Indians citizens? It
  is difficult to say what they are, but they are not citizens. Kent, in his
  commentaries, speaks of them as distinct tribes, living under the protection
  of the government,—2 Kent, 70. Are the free people of color citizens? I
  answer, No. They are not so styled in the Constitution of the United States,
  or, so far as I am aware, in the laws of Congress or of any of the states. In
  that clause of the constitution which fixes the basis of representation, there
  was an opportunity to have called them citizens if they were so considered.
  But that makes free <em>persons</em> (adding three fifths of all other persons,) the basis of representation and
  taxation.”
</p>
<p>
  “They” (the free people of color) are not so styled (citizens) in the
  constitution of the United States.” What then? is it not implied? The
  constitution does not so style free <em>white</em> persons, but does it not imply as much? Again, “In that clause which fixes the
  basis of representation, there was an opportunity to have called them citizens
  if they were so considered.” And so there was an opportunity to have called
  free white people citizens. If the omission excludes the one from citizenship,
  why not the other “But that (the constitution) makes free
  <em>persons</em>
  (adding three fifths of all other persons) the basis of representation and
  taxation.” Now it seems to us that only two classes are here spoken of; first,
  free persons, who, absolutely, form a basis, and next, slaves, only three
  fifths of which form a basis. If then, the characteristic of forming a basis
  for representation and taxation, entire, without division (five fifths of a
  man and not three fifths) constitutes citizenship, by what logic is it
  inferred that
  <em>free</em>
  colored persons are not citizens? The constitution it is true says nothing
  about complexion, but does the omission therefore exclude free colored persons
  If so can any one tell why it does not exclude free white persons?
</p>
<p>
  Judge Daggett says, “another reason for believing that people of color were
  not considered citizens is found in the fact that when the United States
  constitution was adopted, every state except Massachusetts, tolerated
  slavery.” We are dull—we do not see how this related to the point in question.
</p>
<p>
  It was argued in the Court, that free blacks own vessels which participate in
  the peculiar privileges of American shipping, and that blacks may sue in the
  United States courts. This was overruled on the ground that those points had
  never been settled by judicial decisions. We suppose it is true that free
  colored people have owned vessels, and participated in the peculiar privileges
  of American shipping ever since the constitution was formed, that they have
  also had suits in the U.S. Courts, and that they have received protections as
  American Citizens from British impressment. And it seems incredible that this
  should have gone of 57 years, unquestioned, if they were not in reality
  American citizens.
</p>
<p>
  What aid the definition of Webster gives to the decision we do not see. “In
  the United States (a citizen is) a person, native or naturalized, who has the
  privilege of exercising the elective franchise, and of purchasing and holding
  real estate.” Now in seven states the persons in question have the right of
  the elective franchise, and in all the right of purchasing and holding
  realestate. Does not the definition then make against the decision rather than
  for it?
</p>
<p>
  In this decision also Judge Daggett has gone in the face of very high opinion.
  In the Convention of New York for amending the constitution, on the motion to
  insert the word
  <em>white</em>
  before the words “
  <em>male citizens,”</em>
  in the article relating to the right of suffrage, Peter A. Jay said, “Is not
  the right of suffrage a privilege? Can you deny it to a
  <em>citizen</em>
  of Pennsylvania, who comes here and complies with your laws, merely because he
  is not six feet high, or because he is of a dark complexion?’ Chancellor Kent
  said.
</p>
<p>
  “Suppose a
  <em>negro</em>
  owning a freehold, and entitled to vote in Vermont, removes to this state, can
  we constitutionally exclude him from the privilege of voting? The constitution
  of the United States provides that
  <em>citizens</em>
  of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of
  citizens of the several States.”
</p>
<p>Rufus King said</p>
<p>
  ‘Take the fact that a
  <em>citizen of color</em>
  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes here—he purchases a
  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident to his freehold?
  He is entitled to vote because like
  <em>any other citizen</em>
  he is a freeholder, and ever freeholder your laws entitle to vote.’
</p>
<p>And again,</p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
    As certainly as the children of any white men are citizen, so certainly the
    children of black men are citizens.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>Abram Van Vechten said,</p>
<p>
  ‘There is another and to my mind an insuperable objection to the exclusion of
  free citizens of color from the right of suffrage, arising from the provision
  of the Constitution of the U.S. that the citizens of each State shall be
  entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several
  States.’
</p>
<p>
  In 1826 De Witt Clinton demanded of President Adams the release of ‘Gilbert
  Horton a free man of color and a citizen of this state’ (New York) unlawfully
  imprisoned in the District of Columbia, on the ground that he was ‘a free man
  and a citizen.’
</p>
<p>
  We cannot believe with Judge Daggett that the whole free colored population
  of our country is outlawed, that emancipation confers as privilege but that of
  rambling about. And we hope there is a higher appeal yet than the Supreme
  Court of blinded Connecticut before which this case may be tried. We believe
  the people of Canterbury and their abettors are heaping up for themselves a
  load of odium, which they will find it difficult to bear.”

  “Judge Daggett.—This respected magistrate, we perceive, was not compelled, as we supposed, to sentence a Christian sister to an infamous punishment for the crime of teaching other Christian sisters the knowledge by which they could be qualified to do good to their class. The case was carried directly to the Court of Errors. The Hon. Judge, in giving his opinion in favor of the
  <em>constitutionality</em>
  of the “Black law” did not, as we learn by a private letter, commit himself to
  any opinion in favor of the law itself.
</p>
<p>
  The question of constitutionality turned mainly upon this point, whether the
  persons affected by the law are <em>citizens</em> of the United States. The judge relied on the definition in Webster, that
  citizens are those who enjoy the elective franchise, and can hold real estate,
  and it has never been judicially decided that blacks can do this, or sue in
  the United States Courts. A writer in the “Unionist,” who seems to have
  examined the subject, shows that the right of suffrage may be exercised in
  New-Hampshire by male <em>inhabitants;</em>
  in Vt. by a <em>man;</em> in Mass. by male
  <em>citizens;</em>
  (under which term blacks have always voted, and one has held a seat as
  representative,) in R. I. by a <em>subject;</em>
  in N.Y. blacks of certain qualifications can vote; in Pa. every
  <em>freeman,</em> and the same in N.C. and Tenn. The constitutions of Md., Va. N.C. Ky. Ala.
  Miss. Mo. And Lou. limit the right of voting to free <em>white</em> citizens, which would be superfluous unless blacks may be citizens. The same
  number of the Unionist contains extracts from speeches delivered in the
  convention of New-York, 1821, by such men as Peter A. Jay,  James Kent, Rufus
  King, Abraham Van Vechten, all maintaining expressly that people of color are
  citizens. Also a letter from De Witt Clinton to President Adams in 1826,
  claiming Gilbert Horton as ‘a citizen of this State,’ unlawfully imprisoned at

  ‘I would submit to the consideration of the committee whether the proposition
  is consistent with the constitution of the U. States. That instrument provides
  that ‘Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and
  immunities of citizens in the several States.’ No longer ago than last
  November, the Legislature of this State almost unanimously resolved that ‘If
  the provisions contained in any proposed constitution of a new State, deny to
  <em>any citizens</em>
  of the existing States, the privileges and immunities of citizens of such new
  State, that such proposed constitution should not be accepted or confirmed,
  the same in the opinion of this Legislature being void by the Constitution of
  the United States.’ Now Sir, is not the right of suffrage a privilege? Can you

  Union which should have incorporated into her constitution any provision
  denying to the
  <em>citizens</em>
  of each State all the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens of the

  the provision quoted by the gentleman from Albany (Mr. Kent.) Take the fact
  that a
  <em>citizen of color</em>
  entitled to all the privileges of a citizen, comes here—he purchases a
  freehold—can you deny him the rights of an elector incident to his freehold?
  He is entitled to vote because like any

  He comes here, he purchases property, he pays your taxes, conforms to your
  laws—how can you then under the article of the constitution of the U. States
  which has been read exclude him? The gentleman from N. York thinks that the
  meaning of this provision in the U.S. Constitution extends only to civil
  rights. Such is not the text, it is
  <em>all</em>

  than forty years—nay some of them were citizens when this State came into
  political existence—partook in our struggle for freedom and independence, and
  were incorporated into the body politic at its creation. There is another and
  to my mind an insuperable objection to the exclusion of free citizens of color

  Sir,—I have the honor to enclose copies of the proceedings of a&nbsp;
  respectable meeting in West Chester County in the State, and of an Affidavit
  of John Owen, by which it appears that one Gilbert Horton, a free man of color
  <em>and a citizen of this State</em>
  is unlawfully imprisoned in the jail of the city of Washington, and is
  advertised to be sold by the Marshal of the District of Columbia. From
  whatever authority a law authorizing such proceedings may have emanated,
  whether from the municipality of Washington, the Legislature of Maryland, or
  the Congress of the United States, it is at least void and unconstitutional in
  its application to a
  <em>citizen,</em>
  and could never have intended to extend further than to fugitive slaves. As
  the District of Columbia is under the exclusive control of the National
  Government I conceive it my duty to apply to you for the liberation of Gilbert
  Horton as a freeman,
  <em>and a citizen,</em>
  and feel persuaded that this request will be followed by immediate relief.

<p>I have the honor to be &amp;c. DE WITT CLINTON.”</p>

  “We have copied on our last page, from the Brooklyn (Conn.) Unionist, a report
  of the trial of Miss Crandall with the charge of Judge Daggett. It will be
  seen that Judge D. has given it as his opinion, that no colored man is a
  citizen of the United States. This opinion, we are sure, will be viewed with
  astonishment in many parts of the Union. In Massachusetts, the constitution
  and laws have never deprived any man of any privilege on account of the color
  of his skin. The black man there votes, buys and sells real estate, and is
  eligible to the office of Judge, Senator, or Governor. The same is true of
  Maine, and we believe also of Vermont, New Hampshire, and several other
  States. In Connecticut and New York, it is true, the laws are not equally
  creditable to the humanity and republicanism of the people; and in most of the
  states farther south, there are distinctions between different classes of the
  population still more opposed to sound moral and political principle, but we
  believe that Judge D. is the first judge in the United States who has
  officially expressed the opinion, that free colored men are not citizens. We
  cannot believe that this is sound law, and we are supported in this belief by
  some of the ablest jurists in our country, whose opinions we quote below.
</p>
<p>
  While we are on this subject we must caution our foreign friends not to make
  too wide an application of the censure which they may found on the proceedings
  in the case of Miss Crandall. So far as we have noticed, those proceedings,
  beyond the limits of Connecticut, are everywhere viewed with marked
  disapprobation. We regard them as the offspring of a delusion similar to that
  which pervades Georgia in relation to the Cherokees. It is local, and we trust
  it will be temporary.

Communications [Speech of William Pinkney]	The Unionist	Abolition; Constitution	"<em>To the Editors of the Unionist:—</em>
  As many persons are so prejudiced against color as to pronounce a black
  complexion an evidence of Divine displeasure, you are requested to insert in
  the “Unionist” the following extracts from a speech delivered in the
  house of Delegates of Maryland at their session in November, 1789, by that
  upright and enlightened statesman, William Pinkney, Esq. Let his sentiments be
  contrasted with those to whom I have alluded. If as Archbishop Seeker has
  asserted that “every death in battle is a murder,” the writer of this
  introductory article verily believes that for the death of a Slave occasioned
  by his servile condition the owner is responsible, and our country has
  abundant and fearful reason to deprecate the solemn and awful denunciation
  expressed in thsi (sic) sacred interrogatory—“Shall I not visit for these
  things, saith the Lord? Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as
  this?” – HUMANITAS”
</p>
<p>
  “Mr. Speaker, Iniquitous and most dishonorable to Maryland is that dreary
  system of partial bondage, which her laws have hitherto supported with a
  solicitude worthy of a better object, and Citizens by their practice
  countenanced. Founded in a disgraceful traffic, to which the parent country
  lent her fostering aid, from motives of interest, but which even she would
  have disdained to encourage, had England been the destined mart of such
  inhuman merchandize; its continuance is as shameful as its origin.
</p>
<p>
  Eternal infamy await the abandoned miscreants whose selfish souls could ever
  prompt them to rob unhappy Afric of her souls, and freight them hither by
  thousands, to poison the fair Eden of liberty with the rank weed of individual
  bondage. Nor is it more to the credit of our ancestors that they did not
  command these savage spoilers to bear their hateful cargo to another shore,
  where the shrine of freedom knew no votaries, and every purchaser would at
  once be both a master and a slave.
</p>
<p>
  In the dawn of time, Mr. Speaker, when the rough feelings of barbarism had not
  experienced the softening touches of refinement, such an unprincipled
  prostration of the inherent rights of human nature, would have needed the
  gloss of an apology: but to the everlasting reproach of Maryland, be it said,
  that when her citizens rivalled the nation from whence they emigrated, in the
  knowledge of moral principles, and an enthusiasm in the cause of general
  freedom, they stooped to become the purchasers of their fellow creatures, and
  to introduce an hereditary bondage into the bosom of their country, which
  should widen with every successive generation.
</p>
<p>
  For my part, I would willingly draw the veil of oblivion over this disgusting
  scene of iniquity, but that the present abject state of those who are
  descended from these kidnapped sufferers, perpetually brings it forward to the
  memory.
</p>
<p>
  But wherefore should we confine the edge of censure to our ancestors, or those
  from whom they purchased? Are not we equally guilty?
  <em>They</em>
  strewed around the seeds of slavery;
  <em>we</em>
  cherish and sustain the growth.—
  <em>They</em>
  introduced the system;
  <em>we</em>
  enlarge, invigorate, and conform it.—Yes, let it be handed down to posterity,
  that the people of Maryland, who could fly to arms with the promptitude of
  Roman citizens, when the hand of oppression was lifted up against
  themselves—who could behold their country desolated, and their citizens
  slaughtered, who could brave with unshaken firmness, every calamity of war,
  before they would submit to the smallest infringement of their rights—that
  this very people could yet see thousands of their fellow creatures, within the
  limits of their territory, bending beneath an unnatural yoke; and instead of
  being assiduous to destroy their shackles, anxious to immortalize their
  duration, so that a nation of slaves might for ever exist in a country where
  freedom is its boast.
</p>
<p>
  “Even the very earth itself, (says some celebrated author) which teems with
  profusion under the cultivating hand of the freeborn laborer, shrinks into
  barrenness from the contaminating sweat of a slave.” This sentiment is not
  more figuratively beautiful than substantially just.
</p>
<p>
  Survey the countries, sir, where the hand of freedom conducts the ploughshare
  and compare their produce with yours.—Your granaries in this view appear like
  the store houses of emmets [a colloquial word for “ant”], though not supplied
  with equal industry. To trace the cause of this disparity between the fruits
  of a freeman’s voluntary labors, animated by the hope of profit, and the
  slow-paced efforts of a slave, who acts only from compulsion, who has no
  incitement to exertion but fear—no prospect of remuneration to encourage—would
  be insulting the understanding. The cause and the effect are too obvious to
  escape observation.
</p>
<p>
  But it has been said (and who knows but the same opinion may still have its
  advocates) “that nature has black balled these wretches out of society.”
  Gracious God! can it be supposed that thy Almighty Providence intended to
  proscribe these victims of fraud and power, from the pale of society, because
  thou hast denied them the delicacy of an European complexion? Is their color,
  Mr. Speaker, the mark of Divine vengeance, or is it only the flimsy pretext
  upon which we attempt to justify our treatment of them? Arrogant and
  presumptuous is it this to make the dispensations of Providence subservient to
  the purposes of iniquity, and every slight diversity in the works of nature
  the apology for oppression. Thus acts the intemperate bigot in religion. He
  persecutes every dissenter from his creed, in the name of God, and even rears
  the horrid fabric of an inquisition upon heavenly foundations.
</p>
<p>
  I like not these holy arguments. They are as convenient for the tyrant as the
  patriot—the enemy as the friend of mankind. Contemplate this subject through
  the calm medium of philosophy, and then to know that these shackled wretches
  are men as well as we are, spring from the same common parent, and endued with
  equal faculties of mind and body, is to know enough to make us disdain to torn
  casuists on their complexion to the destruction of their rights. The beauty of
  complexion is mere matter of taste, and varies indifferent countries, nay,
  even in the same; and shall we dare to set up this vague, indeterminate,
  weathercock standard, as the criterion by which shall be decided on what
  complexions the rights of human nature are conferred, and to what they are
  denied by the great ordinances of the Deity? As if the Ruler of the Universe
  had made the darkness of a skin, the flatness of a nose, or the wideness of a
  mouth, which are only deformities or beauties as the undulating tribunal of
  taste shall determine the indication of his wrath.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Speaker, It is pitiable to reflect on the mistaken light in which this
  unfortunate generation are viewed by the people in general. Hardly do they
  deign to rank them in the order of beings above the mere animal that grazes
  the field of its owner. That an humble, dusky, unlettered wretch that drags
  the chain of bondage through the weary round of life, with no other privilege
  but that of existing for another’s benefit should have been intended by heaven
  for their equal they will not believe. But let me appeal to the intelligent
  mind, and ask, in what respect they are our inferiors? Though they have never
  been taught to tread the paths of science, or embellish human life by literary
  acquirements; tho’ they cannot soar into the regions of taste and sentiment,
  or explore the scenes of philosophical research, is it to be inferred that
  they want the power, if the yoke of slavery did not check each aspiring effort
  and clog the springs of action? Let the kind hand of an assiduous care mature
  their powers, let the genius of freedom excite to manly thought and liberal
  investigation, we should not then be found to monopolize the vigor of fancy,
  the delicacy of taste, or the solidity of scientific endowments. Born with
  hearts as susceptible of virtuous impressions as our own, and with minds as
  capable of benefitting by improvement, they are in all respects our equals by
  nature; and he who thinks otherwise has never reflected, that talents however
  great may perish unnoticed and unknown, unless auspicious circumstances
  conspire to draw them forth, and animate their exertions in the round of
  knowledge. As well might you expect to see the bubbling fountain gush from the
  burning sands of Arabia, as that the inspiration of genius or the enthusiastic
  glow of sentiment should rouse the mind which has yielded its elasticity to
  habitual subjection. Thus the ignorance and the vices of these wretches are
  solely the result of situation, and therefore no evidence of their
  inferiority. Like the flower whose culture has been neglected, and perishes
  amidst permitted weeds ere it opens it blossom to the Spring, they only prove
  the imbecility of human nature unassisted and oppressed. Well has Cowper said—
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘’Tis
  liberty alone which gives the flower
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of fleeting
  life its lustre and perfume,
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we are
  weeds without it.’

"		William Pinkney (1764-1822) was an important statesman in the Early Republic. Hailing from Maryland, he served that state in Congress and, at the end of his life, in the Senate. He also performed ably as a diplomat and Attorney General. His reputation as an orator was strong. Pinkney's speech here, from early in his career, was in circulation among the Abolitionists; his fame and his writings were amplified in the 1820s at the time of his death.	William Pinkney

Letter to the Editor regarding the <em>Norwich Courier</em>	The Unionist	Abolition; Canterbury Female Academy; Prudence Crandall; Journalistic Debate; Constitution	"<p>
  The following communication from a christian, a philanthropist, and a
  gentleman, we insert with pleasure. The language is energetic, occasionally
  severe, but we hold not ourself answerable for its severity. The circumstances
  of the case justify it. Cruel charges, unsubstantiated by the least shadow of
  evidence, have been too frequently brought against Abolitionists, and we have
  a right to demand the proof or a retraction, and if neither is given, he who
  makes those charge is, to say the least, a traducer of character.
</p>
<p><em>For the Unionist.</em></p>
<p>To the Editor of the Norwich Courier</p>
<p>
  SIR—I presume that you will agree with me in the sentiment that the editor of
  a public journal is under weighty responsibilities, and should suffer nothing
  to appear in the columns of his publication but with extreme caution. Opinions
  disseminated through the columns of a newspaper will, to a greater or less
  degree, influence the opinions of the reading community, and when the editor
  of a paper advocates any particular doctrine, he doubtless desires that his
  readers may adhere to the same doctrine. Great care therefore is necessary
  that a person in your connexion with community should disseminate thro’ that
  community, precepts which shall bear the test of truth—principles founded upon
  the strictest rules of justice and sound morality. You sir, I presume,
  professing to be governed by high and honorable motives, will readily assent
  to this, and at all times be willing to turn your attention to any thing which
  may have escaped your pen, and if any one of your readers should be so
  unfortunate as to differ from you in sentiment, you will, I presume,
  cheerfully examine the ground of their complaints, to be convinced, or to show
  some reason for a different course.
</p>
<p>
  I would request of you, sir, to re-peruse an article which appeared under your
  editorial head, Oct. 23d, in relation to Miss Crandall’s school and the
  sentiments of the abolitionists. I would ask you to do it calmly and
  dispassionately—
  <em>searching for the truth</em>
  —unbiased by opinions previously expressed, farther than you find
  <em>reason</em>
  to be your supporter.
</p>
<p>
  You say, “Although we think that Miss Crandall has a right to continue her
  school we are by no means friendly to the doctrines which are said to be
  taught in it; yet these doctrines can never be put down by persecution—they
  must be met by fair argument, and in such a contest they will prove wholly
  untenable.” I am glad to find that you have never denied the
  <em>right</em>
  of Miss Crandall to teach such a school—it is rather a matter or surprise to
  me, as it probably is to you, that New-England should contain an enlightened
  man who
  <em>would</em>
  deny that right. I know not what doctrines you have heard to be taught in that
  school, neither have you seen fit to inform the public. But you have said that
  <em>dangerous</em>
  doctrines are taught there that ought to be “put down.” If so, are not you,
  sir, bound to tell us what these doctrines are, as you wish to enlighten the
  public all you can—to overthrow these dangerous doctrines, and to free society
  from their contamination, will you not condescend to meet them by “fair
  argument,” as “in such a contest” you are confident “they will prove wholly
  untenable?” I am anxious to see, what I have never yet seen and feat I never
  shal, the attempt made to “put them down” by “fair argument,” instead of
  addled eggs, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
  You say again, “The least that can be said of the Abolition scheme is that it
  is an
  <em>insane</em>
  project—one which no man in the full possession and exercise of his faculties
  can contemplate as being practicable, or at the present time desirable.” I
  know, sir, it is very easy for a person, especially when under a little
  excitement, to go on and make severe accusations against his opponents, but it
  is quite another thing to show the reason of these accusations. I might say
  that the editor of the Norwich Courier was governed by passion and prejudice,
  with as much ease as you charge Abolitionists of insanity; and I doubt not,
  sir, that I should be able to substantiate my charge as soon as you yours. I
  have seen similar charges in your paper before, but I have never known of your
  being more particular. You are satisfied with making a general assertion, why
  not specify wherein this insanity consists? The leading doctrine of the
  Abolitionists is that no man has a right to hold his fellow man in bondage a
  single moment. Is this insane? Is it untrue? Is it a fact that man
  <em>has a right</em>
  to rob his fellow man of liberty—of
  <em>himself?</em>
  If he
  <em>has</em>
  such a right, tell me, sir, who gave him that right, and how long it is to
  continue. If he has a
  <em>right</em>
  to hold him in bondage
  <em>one</em>
  moment, how many moments may he have that right? But who are these insane
  Abolitionists? How long since this spirit of insanity come upon them? They are
  all around you—men of distinguished worth—of brilliant talents—to whom you,
  sire, in your highest estimation of yourself, never considered yourself worthy
  to be called an equal. You accuse them of forwarding a project which is not
  desirable. Do you pronounce them all hypocrites? No, you dare not, but they
  are
  <em>insane,</em>
  and therefore may be, for aught you know, sincere. But they are men of
  exemplary piety—men of fervent prayer—of extensive influence in promoting the
  cause of our Redeemer. You have not been accustomed to pronounce them
  insane—even now you are ready to quote their opinions upon other subjects and
  would place more confidence in their judgment than in your own. How happens it
  that their insanity is confined to this subject alone?
</p>
<p>
  You say, “The agitators appear to have bid adieu to common sense and a regard
  for the constitution and the laws,” &amp;c. I know not what you call bidding
  adieu to common sense, but one thing I know, that the leading Abolitionists in
  our country are the leading men in every other project to benefit the human
  race—men distinguished for their moral courage, seeking for the approval of
  God rather than for the favor of man. They have inquired for the path of duty
  and having ascertained it they have not failed to run in that path. Some,
  perhaps, might say that common sense in this respect is a disposition to act
  in a manner most congenial with popular feeling, If this is your definition of
  the term, I admit that they have ‘bid adieu to common sense,’ but as I
  understand the term they have most strictly adhered to it.
</p>
<p>
  As for the charge of their disregarding the constitution and the laws, I think
  it a very grave accusation to be brought against many of the best men of our
  country. But you, sir, are not the only one who has seen fit to make
  it—neither are you the only one who has made it without specifying what part
  of the constitution or what laws they disregard—and I must tell you, sire,
  that neither you nor all the wholesale accusers who you join
  <em>can</em>
  point out a single line of our constitution from which Abolitionists, as such,
  have departed. “Bid adieu to a regard for the constitution!” It is not
  true—and I here call upon you, sir, to clear your character from the
  imputation of falsehood. I would not say, sir, that you
  <em>intended</em>
  to assert an untruth, but I
  <em>do</em>
  say that you
  <em>have</em>
  asserted one, and unless you retract or substantiate it, the charge of
  falsehood must rest upon you. Is it unconstitutional to assert that it is
  morally wrong to hold slaves? Does the constitution of a free, republican
  people forbid that we should
  <em>speak against</em>
  chaining the mortal body and degrading the immortal mind? Is it against the
  constitution of a Christian people to declaim against the cruel system of
  slavery? —to say that it is contrary to the righteous laws of God—that it is
  inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel and the precepts of our Savior? Is
  it a fact that the
  <em>republicans</em>
  of the United States hold one sixth of their number in the chains of the
  veriest despotism—that
  <em>two millions</em>
  of our fellow creatures are groaning under worse than Egyptian servitude—that
  <em>two million</em>
  of immortal souls are shut out from the light of science and closed to the
  entrance of one cheering ray from the Sun of Righteousness—and that when a few
  fearless men stand forth and say that these things are
  <em>wrong,</em>
  you, the editor of a public journal, cry out that in so saying they have “bid
  adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Tell me, sir, if these things are
  facts? O that you could tell me that they were not facts! But, alas! they are.
  We must not say that it is
  <em>wrong</em>
  to degrade the image of God to a level with the brutes that perish, for it is
  unconstitutional. Thank God!&nbsp; we have no such constitution as this! Shame
  on my countrymen! Shame on any republican asserting such a doctrine! I know
  the constitution
  <em>permits</em>
  the several states to hold slaves if they choose—but no where does it say that
  we
  <em>shall not</em>
  raise our voices against this abominable system. Wherein, then, have
  Abolitionists “bid adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Will you, sir,
  point out this treason, or cease longer to make an unfounded accusation?
</p>
<p>
  You say, “That this unprincipled opposition to the labors of the Colonization
  Society will raise up many warm friends to the latter there is abundant ground
  to hope.” As “unprincipled,: sir, as these ‘agitators’ may be, I deem it no
  disparagement to you to say that they are men in the splendor of whose moral
  qualities you would be hardly visible, and whose names will be breathed with
  veneration by the virtuous and the good when yours shall have long been
  forgotten. But I am perfectly willing that you should, if you can, console
  yourself that by this opposition many warm friends will be raised up to the
  Colonization Society, but perhaps it may soften future disappointment, to
  inform you that many of those who have been :warm friends” to that society are
  flocking around the Abolition standard, and however many ‘warm friends’ the
  Colonization Society may have, the cause of Abolition must forever stand. AS
  long as justice reigns in heaven and sin is found on earth, so long will those
  be found who will exert themselves to hasten the triumph of the former and
  crush and extirpate the latter, and as sure as God is good so sure will he
  cause them to prosper.
</p>
<p>
  Again you say, “If the blacks are to be benefitted at all, it can only be
  accomplished by the aid of the Colonization Society, and their removal to
  Africa.” O that you had spared the penning of that sentence! What principle do
  you mean to advocate? Into what would you convert our happy land? What, sir,
  shall we think of the man, professing to be governed by that religion which
  commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves, who tells us that here are two
  and a half millions of immortal beings among us, degraded and wretched, and if
  they “are to be benefitted at all” it must be by “their removal to Africa?”
  What, in the name of God, is the reason they cannot be benefitted here? What
  but that you and some of your brother editors are so wickedly prejudiced
  against them that you are determined they
  <em>shall not be?</em>
  They
  <em>can</em>
  be benefitted here—they
  <em>will</em>
  be benefitted here. The number of blacks in this country will never be less
  than at the present moment—for in the first place we have not the means to
  make them less, increasing as they do 70,000 per year, and in the second place
  if we had the means of carrying them to Africa they do not want to go. They
  must always remain with us unless we serve them as we have served the poor
  Indians, and though you may continue to assert that they must always remain
  degraded, yet ever true Christian will rejoice that God in his good providence
  has ordered it otherwise.

Declaration of the National Anti-Slavery Society	The Unionist	Abolition; National News	"<p>DECLARATION OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION.</p>
<p>
  The Convention, assembled in the City of Philadelphia to organize a National
  Anti-Slavery Society, promptly seize the opportunity to promulgate the
  following DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS, as cherished by them in relation to the
  enslavement of one-sixth portion of the American people.
</p>
<p>
  More than fifty-seven years have elapsed since a band of patriots convened in
  this place, to devise measures for the deliverance of this country from a
  foreign yoke. The corner-stone upon which they founded the TEMPLE OF FREEDOM
  was broadly this—“that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by
  their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life,
  LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.” At the sound of their trumpet-call,
  three millions of people rose up as from the sleep of death, and rushed to the
  strife of blood; deeming it more glorious to die instantly as freemen, than
  desirable to live one hour as slaves.—They were few in number—poor in
  resources; but the honest conviction that Truth and Justice, were on their
  side, made them invincible.
</p>
<p>
  We have met together for the achievement of an enterprise, without which, that
  of our fathers is incomplete, and which, for its magnitude, solemnity, and
  probable results upon the destiny of the world, as far transcends theirs, as
  moral truth does physical force.
</p>
<p>
  In purity of motive, in earnestness of zeal, in decision of purpose, in
  intrepidity of action, in stead fastness of faith, in sincerity of spirit, we
  would not be inferior to them.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Their</em>
  principles led them to wage war against their oppressors, and to spill human
  blood like water, in order to be free.
  <em>Ours</em>
  forbid the doing of evil that good may come, and lead us to reject, the use of
  all carnal weapons for deliverance from bondage—relying solely upon those
  which are spiritual, and mighty through God to the pulling down of strong
  holds.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Their</em>
  measures were physical resistance—the marshalling in arms—the hostile
  array—the mortal encounter.
  <em>Ours</em>
  shall be such only as the opposition of moral purity to moral corruption—the
  destruction of error by the potency of truth—the overthrow of prejudice by the
  power of love—and the abolition of slavery by the spirit of repentance.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Their</em>
  grievances, great as they were, were trifling in comparison with the wrongs
  and sufferings of those for whom we plead. Our fathers were never slaves—never
  bought and sold like cattle—never shut out from the light of knowledge and
  religion—never subjected to the lash of brutal taskmasters.
</p>
<p>
  But those, for whose emancipation we are striving, —constituting at the
  present time at least one-sixth part of our countrymen, are recognized by the
  laws, and treated by their fellow beings, as marketable commodities—as goods
  and chattels—as brute beasts—are plundered daily of the fruits of their toil
  without redress;—really enjoy no constitutional nor legal protection from
  licentious and murderous outrages upon their persons;—are ruthlessly torn
  asunder—the tender babe from the arms of its frantic mother—the heart-broken
  wife from her weeping husband—at the caprice or pleasure of irresponsible
  tyrants;—and, for the crime of having a dark complexion, suffer the pangs of
  hunger, the infliction of stripes, and the ignominy of brutal servitude. They
  are kept in heathenish darkness by laws expressly enacted to make their
  instruction a criminal offence.
</p>
<p>
  These are the prominent circumstances in the condition of more than TWO
  MILLIONS of our people, proof of which may be found in thousands of
  indisputable facts, and in the laws of the slaveholding States.
</p>
<p>Hence we maintain—</p>
<p>
  That in view of the civil and religious privileges of this nation, the guilt
  of its oppression is unequalled by any other on the face of the earth;—and,
  therefore,
</p>
<p>
  That it is bound to repent instantly, to undo the heavy burden, to break every
  yoke, and let the oppressed go free.
</p>
<p>We farther maintain—</p>
<p>
  That no man has a right to enslave or imbrute his brother—to hold or
  acknowledge him, for one moment, as a piece of merchandise—to keep back his
  hire by fraud—or to brutalize his mind by denying him the means of
  intellectual, social and moral improvement.
</p>
<p>
  The right to enjoy liberty is inalienable. To invade it, is to usurp the
  prerogative of Jehovah. Every man has a right to his own body—to the products
  of his own labor—to the protection of law—and to the common advantages of
  society. It is piracy to buy or steal a native African and subject him to
  servitude. Surely the sin is as great to enslave an American as an African.
</p>
<p>Therefore we believe and affirm—</p>
<p>
  That there is no difference,
  <em>in principle,</em>
  between the African slave trade and American slavery;
</p>
<p>
  That every American citizen, who retains a human being in involuntary bondage,
  is [according to Scripture] a MAN-STEALER;
</p>
<p>
  That the slaves ought instantly to be set free, and brought under the
  protection of law;
</p>
<p>
  That if they had lived from the time of Pharaoh down to the present period,
  and had been entailed through successive generations, their right to be free
  could never have been alienated, but their claims would have constantly risen
  in solemnity;
</p>
<p>
  That all those laws which are not in force, admitting the right of slavery,
  are therefore before God utterly null and void, being an audacious usurpation
  of the Divine prerogative, a daring infringement on the law of nature, a base
  overthrow of the very foundations of the social compact, a complete extinction
  of all the relations, endearments and obligations of mankind, and a
  presumptuous transgression of all the holy commandments—and that therefore
  they ought to be instantly abrogated.
</p>
<p>We further believe and affirm—</p>
<p>
  That all persons of color who possess the qualifications which are demanded of
  others, ought to be admitted forthwith to the enjoyment of the same
  privileges, and the exercise of the same prerogatives, as others; and that the
  paths of preferment, of wealth. and of intelligence, shall be opened as widely
  to them as to persons of a white complexion.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain that no compensation should be given to the planters emancipating
  their slaves—
</p>
<p>
  Because it would be a surrender of the great fundamental principle that man
  cannot hold property in man;
</p>
<p>
  Because
  <em>Slavery is a crime, and therefore is not an article to be sold;</em>
</p>
<p>
  Because the holders of slaves are not the just proprietors of what they claim;
  freeing the slaves is not depriving them of property, but restoring it to the
  right owner; —it is not wronging the master, but righting the slave—restoring
  him to himself;
</p>
<p>
  Because immediate and general emancipation would only destroy nominal, not
  real property it would not amputate a limb or break a bone of the slaves, but
  by infusing motives into their breasts, would make them doubly valuable to the
  masters as free laborers; and
</p>
<p>
  Because if compensation is to be given at all, it should be given to the
  outraged and guiltless slaves, and not to those who have plundered and abused
  them.
</p>
<p>
  We regard, as delusive, cruel and dangerous, any scheme of expatriation which
  pretends to aid, either directly or indirectly, in the emancipation of the
  slaves, or to be a substitute for the immediate and total abolition of
  slavery.
</p>
<p>
  We fully and unanimously recognize the sovereignty of each State, to legislate
  exclusively on the subject of the slavery which is tolerated within its
  limits. We concede that Congress, under the present national compact, has no
  right to interfere with any of the slave states, in relation to this momentous
  subject.
</p>
<p>
  But we maintain that Congress has a right, and is solemnly bound, to suppress
  the domestic slave trade between the several States, and to abolish slavery in
  those portions of our territory which the Constitution has placed under its
  exclusive jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
  We also maintain that there are, at the present time, the highest obligations
  resting upon the people of the free States, to remove slavery by moral and
  political action, as prescribed in the Constitution of United States. They are
  now living under a pledge of their tremendous physical force to fasten the
  galling fetters of tyranny upon the limbs of millions in the southern
  States;—they are liable to be called at any moment to suppress a general
  insurrection of the slaves;—they authorize the slave owner to vote for
  three-fifths of his slaves as property, and thus enable him to perpetuate his
  oppression;—they support a standing army at the south for its protection;—and
  they seize the slave who has escaped into their territories, and send him back
  to be tortured by an enraged master or a brutal driver.
</p>
<p>
  This relation to slavery is criminal and full of danger:
  <em>it must be broken up.</em>
</p>
<p>
  These are our views and principles—these, our designs and measures. With
  entire confidence in the overruling justice of God, we plant ourselves upon
  the Declaration of our Independence, and upon the truth of Divine Revelation,
  as upon the Everlasting Rock.
</p>
<p>
  We shall organize Anti-Slavery Societies, if possible, in every city, town and
  village of our land.
</p>
<p>
  We shall send forth Agents to lift up the voice of remonstrance, of warning of
  entreaty and rebuke.
</p>
<p>
  We shall circulate, unsparingly and extensively, anti slavery tracts and
  periodicals.
</p>
<p>
  We shall enlist the Pulpit and the Press in the cause of the suffering and the
  dumb.
</p>
<p>
  We shall aim at a purification of the churches from all participation in the
  guilt of slavery.
</p>
<p>
  We shall encourage the labor of freemen over that of the slaves, by giving a
  preference to their productions;—and
</p>
<p>
  We shall spare no exertions nor means to bring the whole nation to speedy
  repentance.
</p>
<p>
  Our trust for victory is solely in GOD.
  <em>We</em>
  may be personally defeated, but our principles never. TRUTH, JUSTICE, and
  HUMANITY, must and will gloriously triumph. Already a host is coming up to the
  help of the Lord against the mighty, and the prospect before us is full of
  encouragement.
</p>
<p>
  Submitting this DECLARATION to the candid examination of the people of this
  country, and of the friends of liberty all over the world, we hereby affix our
  signatures to it; pledging ourselves that, under the guidance and by the help
  of Almighty God, we will do all that in us lies, consistently with this
  Declaration of our principles, to overthrow the most execrable system of
  slavery that has ever been witnessed upon earth—to deliver our land from its
  deadliest curse—to wipe out the foulest stain which rests upon our national
  escutcheon—and to secure to the colored population of the United States all
  the rights and privileges which belong to them as men and as Americans—come
  what may to our persons, our interests, or our reputations—whether we live to
  witness the triumph of Justice, Liberty and Humanity, or perish untimely as
  martyrs in this great, benevolent, and holy cause.

"		"There is much to add, relevant to <em>The Unionist</em> and the Canterbury Female Academy, to this Declaration. <p>
  In the same issue of <em>The Abolitionist</em> that printed the Declaration, African-American delegate Robert Purvis delivered an encomium for William Lloyd Garrison:
  <em>The Abolitionist</em>
  1:12:183 (December 1833)
</p><p>In a pair of motions intimately related to the Canterbury Female Academy, the convention expressed its appreciation of education in general, and Canterbury in particular.</p>
<p>""On motion of Simeon S. Jocelyn, seconded by Amos A. Phelps, it was</p>
<p>
  Resolved.&nbsp; That the fountains of knowledge, like those of salvation,
  should be open to every creature, and that we regard those laws and prejudices
  which prevent or restrict the education of the people of color, bond or free,
  as pre-eminently cruel and impious, and disgraceful to a christian state or
  nation; and that we will seek their abolishment, both in the free and slave
  States, if possible more earnestly than corporeal slavery itself, in as much
  as ignorance enslaves the mind, and tends to the ruin of the immortal soul.
</p>
<p>On motion of John Prentice, seconded by William Goodell, it was</p>
<p>
  Resolved, That this convention highly approve of the philanthropic effort of
  Miss Prudence Crandall of Canterbury, Conn. in her labors to instruct our
  colored sisters; and while we deeply sympathize with her in view of the
  persecutions she has endured in the prosecution of her pious purposes, we
  pledge ourselves to afford her our continued countenance and assistance""
  <em>The Abolitionist</em>
  1:12:184 (December 1833) Goodell was the editor of <em>The Genius of Temperance</em>; Jocelyn and Phelps were both endorsers of the Canterbury Female Academy.
</p>
<p>
  <em>The Abolitionist</em> in that same December issue also published a letter from Charles Stuart to William Lloyd Garrison, that
  made reference also to letters from Buffum and
  Forten: ""Many hearts are beating here for the glorious Prudence
  Crandall. Some of my young friends are working little parcels of
  presents for me to take to her dear pupils in the Spring."" (written from
  Liverpool)

<p>
  Samuel Joseph May and John G. Whittier worked with the principal author, William Lloyd Garrison, on the 1833 Declaration of Sentiments of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The language of the Declaration, and the sense of who was behind it, demonstrates how nonviolence already held some prominence in the movement at the time of the Canterbury Female Academy. Furthermore, they were working at the home of African-American activist and dentist James McCrummell (Benjamin Quarles, <em>Black Abolitionists</em> New York: Da Capo Press, 1991; original edition 1969, p. vii-viii)

Is It Safe to Obey God?	The Unionist	Abolition; Religion	"<p>THE UNIONIST</p>
<p>BROOKLYN, DECEMBER 19, 1833.</p>
<p>
  <em>Is it safe to obey God?—</em>
  Startle not at the query, reader, but answer it candidly. Has God commanded us
  to do any thing which would be unsafe and
  inexpedient for us to do? If he has, then, painful as it might seem, it is our
  duty to obey, for surely God will not require an unnecessary sacrifice of any
  one. But we believe that it is not only always
  <em>safe</em>
  to obey the commands of God, but that our safety consists in such obedience
  alone. We believe that He commands us to do nothing except what is for our
  best good, and that we are not safe for a moment while we refuse to obey.
  Should we not therefore obey
  <em>all</em>
  the commands of God—
  <em>now ‑ immediately?</em>
  We should—the candid and christian reader will echo the reply,
  <em>“we should!”</em>
  Well—so much for the sermon, now for the application.
</p>
<p>
  God has commanded—
  <em>“Undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free.”</em>
  Not yet, says the colonizationist—the oppressed, though they are happy and
  contended in their bondage, would so highly resent the gift of liberty and the
  proffer of kindness and sympathy that they would cut our throats for the gift
  and burn our dwellings for the proffer. It would not be safe to obey the
  command of God NOW—wait, and let us leave off sinning by degrees and make a
  compromise with God that will leave us in our sins a few years longer. Such
  is, in effect, the reasoning of the apologist for slavery. When will the time
  come in which men will think it sage and expedient to obey the Supreme Ruler
  of the Universe?
</p>
"	"I corrected an obvious printer's error in the line ""Has God commanded us
  to do any thing which would be unsafe and
  inexpedient for us to do?"" - where the word ""and"" was rendered as ""are."""	Biblical reference is to Isaiah 58:6
A Few Questions	The Unionist	Abolition; Religion	"<p>
  A FEW QUESTIONS—We do not wish to be impertinent, nor meddle with that which
  is none of our business—but we wish to ask a few questions, and we do it with
  a sincere desire to do good, whether we shall, to any extent, effect our
  object we leave for time to determine.
</p>
<p>“Is the holding of our fellow men in bondage a sin?”</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;“Is it our duty ever to repent of sin, and if so, when? now or at some
  indefinite future?
</p>
<p>
  Do any clergymen who preach to their hearers the duty of&nbsp; immediate
  repentence oppose immediate emancipation, the immediate restoration of right
  to the slave who has long been robbed of his earnings and treated as a brute?
  and if so where is his consistency?
</p>
<p>
  Has God pronounced a judgment upon him who withholds from the laborer his
  hire? If so is the slaveholder obnoxious to this judgment?
</p>
<p>Can that man who is a habitual robber be a christian?</p>
<p>
  Is not the slaveholder who refuses to emancipate his slaves a robber of man
  and of God? Reader, ponder these questions well—and answer them to your
  conscience and your God.
</p>

The cause of Temperance	The Unionist	Allied Reform Movements - Temperance	"The cause of Temperance prospers well in Massachusetts. Our good friends there
are doing nobly—they have their heart in the work. MR. FROST, the Apostle of
Temperance, and an eloquent and able man, has been lecturing in Norfolk County,
and his labors have been attended with the most gratifying success. Those of our
friends who have had the pleasure of hearing Mr. F. will not be surprised at
this. He possesses to an eminent degree the power of awakening and enchaining
the attention. His oratory is peculiar to himself—at least we never heard of its
model or successful imitation—always elevated and always fascinating. His voice
is musical—his gesticulation forcible, and, more than all, his acquaintance with
his subject in all its bearing is perfect, and his facility in rightly arranging
and applying sarcasm and argument, ridicule and persuasion, truly wonderful. By
Mr. Frost’s report it appears that when he commenced his agency in the County,
there were twenty-eight Temperance Societies, embracing 6,511 members, to which
have been added 2,375 others, and fourteen new societies have been organized,
embracing 761 members. This tells well for Temperance effort in Massachusetts.
Let our Connecticut friends do likewise.
"		I have not yet determined if the hyper-active Temperance Advocate Daniel Frost is the same as the Daniel Frost, Jr., of Canterbury (1787-1863), who was among the opponents of the Canterbury Female Academy.	Daniel Frost
Seeing Angels	The Unionist	African-American Students; Education	"Two men in Chatham, Ct. lately saw, according to their own account, an angel! To
one of them the celestial visitant appeared three different times, revealing to
him a future famine and an earthquake. Now we see no propriety in trying to make
it appear as something very strange to see an angel. Such sights are by no means
rare in Brooklyn. We see some half dozen every day—and by happy smiles that so
beautifully curl their pouting ruby lips we should suppose they were thinking of
things more agreeable than famine and earthquake. Ours are intellectual angels
withal, for we usually see them with a book under one arm—and—and—but we are a
confirmed bachelor and dare not venture another word upon the subject.
"		Because William Burleigh was teaching at the Canterbury Female Academy, it is likely he wrote this commentary about his angelic students. This was as defiant of racial norms as was the naming of the school for "Young Ladies and Little Misses of Color." Similar to that move, it may sound discordant to our twenty-first century ears, as if this was a salacious comment, but I doubt it was intended that way.
National Anti-Slavery Convention was not held behind closed doors	The Unionist	Abolition	"<p>
  We have heard complaints made relative to the National Anti-Slavery Convention
  that their sitting was with closed doors.&nbsp; This assertion has been
  repeatedly made in our presence, with apparent exultation in the belief that
  the statement would injure the cause—and though we do not love to goad the
  already desperate, truth compels us to assert, that the charge is utterly
  false. The convention did NOT sit, during any portion of their session, with
  closed doors. We make this assertion fearlessly—for our informant is one whose
  veracity is unquestionable—JOHN G. WHITTIER, who was himself Secretary of the
  convention.
</p>
<p>
  We have no doubt but the formation of the National Society will madden the
  foes of liberty, and drive them to the more frequent use of their old weapons,
  vituperation and falsehood, but the cause of truth and justice is onward,
  onward, and its progress cannot be staid. Check the flow of the ocean-tide,
  fetter the leaping lightning, hold back the sun from his course of strength,
  but seek not to impede the march of Emancipation.

"		G. Tillotson was Rev. George Jeffrey Tillotson (1805-1888), Congregational minister of Brooklyn Connecticut. He was the minister who agreed to officiate the marriage of Prudence Crandall and Calvin Philleo, when the Congregational minister of Canterbury declined on the day of the wedding. He had begun his ministerial career in Brooklyn with the Execution Sermon for Oliver Watkins, the murderer whose cell in the Brooklyn Jail later housed Prudence Crandall. For the text of that sermon, see <em>Windham County Advertiser</em>, 5:52 (August 2, 1831), p. 3. Tillotson had a personal friendship with Abolitionist and Crandall endorser Amos A. Phelps; see this <a href="https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search?f%5Bname_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Tillotson%2C+George+Jeffrey%2C+1805-1888">digitized collection of letters.</a> After the Civil War, he donated substantially to an institution of higher learning for Freedmen in Austin, Texas, which was named the <a href="https://www.pvamu.edu/tiphc/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/GeorgeTillotson.pdf">Tillotson Institute</a> in his honor.

<p align=""center"">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</p>
<p align=""right"">TUESDAY, December 10.</p>
<p>
  On motion of Mr McDuffie, the Report of the Secretary on the removal of the
  deposites [sic], was taken up and referred to the Committee of the Whole on
  the state of the Union.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Pinckney, of South Carolina, rose and stated that he held in his hand
  certain resolutions which he would respectfully ask leave to offer for
  adoption by the House. He believed that it had always been customary for the
  House to adopt suitable tributes of respect to its deceased members. The S.C.
  delegation had heard, with deep regret, of the death of their colleague, the
  Hon. Thomas D. Singleton, and it was his painful duty to communicate that
  mournful information to the House. He died at Raleigh, whilst on his journey
  to the Capitol, whither he was hastening to assume his seat, and to discharge
  his duties, as a member of this body. ****
</p>
<p>
  With these few remarks, which he had felt it his duty to submit, in justice to
  the character of one whose memory deserved a far better tribute than any he
  could offer, he now proposed the following resolutions for the consideration
  of the House;
</p>
<p>
  Resolved, That we have received, with deep regret, the melancholy intelligence
  of the death of the Hon. THO’S D. SINGLETON, a Representative elect from the
  State of South Carolina.
</p>
<p>
  Resolved, That this House tender the expression of their sympathy to the
  relatives of the deceased, upon this mournful event; and that, in testimony of
  their regret for the loss, and respect for his memory, the members will wear
  crape upon the left arm for thirty days.
</p>
<p>The House then adjourned.</p>
<p>IN SENATE</p>
<p>THURSDAY, December 12.</p>
<p>
  A Message from the President was received by the hands of Mr Donalson, his Private Secretary, which was read as follows:
</p>
<p>
  I have attentively considered the resolution of the Senate of the 11th
  instant, requesting the President of the United States to communicate to the
  Senate ""a copy of the paper which has been published, and which purports to
  have been read by him to the heads of the Executive Departments, dated the
  18th day of September last, relating to the removal of the deposits of the
  public money from the Bank of the United States and its offices.""
  <br />
  The executive is a co-ordinate and independent branch of the Government
  equally with the Senate, and I have yet to learn under what constitutional
  authority that branch of the Legislature has a right to require of me an
  account of any communication, either verbally or in writing, made to the heads
  of Departments acting as a Cabinet council. As well might I be required to
  detail to the Senate the free and private conversations I have held with those
  officers on any subject relating to their duties and my own.
  <br />
  Feeling my responsibility to the American people, I am willing upon all
  occasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct, and I am willing upon
  all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature any
  information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the
  appropriate duties confided to them.
  <br />
  Knowing the constitutional rights of the Senate, I shall be the last man under
  any circumstances to interfere with them. Knowing those of the Executive, I
  shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to the provisions of
  the Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to support and defend it.
  <br />
  I am constrained, therefore, by a proper sense of my own self-respect and of
  the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the
  Government to decline a compliance with your request. ANDREW JACKSON
</p>
<p>After the message had been read,</p>
<p>
  Mr Clay said, that a call had been made on the President for a copy of a
  document which has been published and extensively circulated by the papers in
  this city—a document intimately connected with the safety of the treasure of
  the country. The call for it was made under the full conviction that the Senate
  ought to have that document. It had been refused, under the pretext that the
  rights of the Chief Magistrate were invaded by it. He always would be disposed
  to respect the rights of every public officer, but the President could have no
  more confidence in his rights, then I feel in the rights of the Senate. The
  right of the Senate to call for this paper was founded on the ground that the
  whole world was already in possession of it. It was made because the document
  was sent forth to the American people upon an all-important subject, and
  because it was the right of the Senate to have it. Nor was it made because the
  call was in violation of precedent or an established usage. But the President
  has refused to give us this document, and it was not necessary to proceed
  further in the pursuit. One result happens from it. The President don’t deny
  the genuineness of the paper. It is before the world, and as we have endeavored
  to get it, and it has been refused, I have a right to take the next best
  evidence of the document, and that is as it has been published in the official
  paper. In every instance, therefore, where I have occasion to use it, I shall
  avail myself of that publication of it, as genuine.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Grundy said he thought when the proposition was made, that it was a very
  unnecessary procedure.
</p>
<p>
  Here the presiding office interposed that the debate was out of order unless
  some motion was intended to be made.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Grundy said he intended to move, before he concluded, that the message be
  laid on the table; and then resumed—
</p>
<p>
  That he thought it unnecessary, because we only wanted evidence when facts had
  not come to our knowledge, or when they are denied.—Now, he believed that both
  friends and enemies admitted this document to be genuine—to be what it
  purported to be. He therefore had thought that nothing beneficial could result
  from this proposition, and this was what induced him to vote against it. The
  President has given his objection to complying with the call, and what is it?
  Why, that the Senate has asked for a private communication from the Chief
  Magistrate to his Cabinet. He, [Mr. G.] would never question the propriety of
  the motives of the Senator who wanted this information. But the President has.
</p>
<p align=""center"">IN SENATE.</p>
<p align=""right"">WEDNESDAY, December 11, 1833.</p>
<p>
  Mr Bibb, pursuant to notice given, presented certain joint resolutions
  providing or an alteration in the Constitution of the United States, in
  relation to the mode of electing the President, and Vice President, and then
  moved to lay the same on the table and print them. Mr. B. said he felt no
  disposition to press the consideration of the resolutions now, and therefore
  moved that the second Monday in January next be assigned for taking them up,
  and also the resolutions offered by Mr. Benton somedays since, on the same
  subject, at the same time; which was agreed to.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Clay moved the consideration of Mr Benton’s resolution, relative to the
  amount of moneys in deposite [sic] at particular periods in the Bank of the
  United States.
</p>
<p><em>Apparently a line is missing here</em></p>
<p>
  Said that it is a matter which you have no right to interrogate him about;
  and his opinion is, too, that to comply with the request would be setting a
  dangerous precedent. He [Mr G.] was not inclined to sat any thing on the
  subject of the removal of the deposits, when that matter should come up for
  consideration. But if he did, he could not, even if he were so disposed, speak
  of that paper as any other than a genuine one, or deny its authenticity. He
  therefore moved to key the message on the table; which was agreed to.
</p>

  —The Rochester Daily Advertiser, relates that on the evening of the 28
  <sup>th</sup>
  ult. the house of Mr. Wm. Irvine, in Ulster county, was consumed by fire, with
  all if contents, and three children, sons of Mr. I. from six to twelve years
  of age, perished in the flames. The fire broke out after the family had
  retired to bed, and made such progress before it was discovered, that nothing
  could be saved from the house, and even the [indecipherable] appeared lying by
  the bed sides. How it originated is not known, but it took in the second story
  where the children were sleeping; there were four of them; they were all
  awakened by the flames, and some of them started for the window, but only the
  eldest, a lad of 14 about reached it and leaped out; his brothers did not
  follow, and were lost. Their remains were found the next day in the ruins.
  Besides the loss to Mr. Irvine of his children, he has been entirely stripped
  of his effects, and has a daughter who escaped from the flames with simply a
  blanket around her in very feeble health.

Some further particulars relating to the conflict between the Mormonites and the

said that one Judge of the circuit, and several civil officers were thrown into

and the Lieut. Governor had been driven out of the county. Almost all the people

  In presenting to the public the October number of the LADY’S BOOK, the
  Proprietors feel much pleasure in inviting attention to a comparison between
  it and the preceding numbers. It will be perceived that a gradual, but decided
  improvement, has been effected in its embellishments; particularly in the
  department of costume fashions, which have been executed by KELLY; an artist
  who, in the Embellishment which accompanies this, has literally excelled
  himself; rendering the prints of Fashions of the LADY’S BOOK sufficiently
  excellent to compete with the best executed in London, and to surpass those of
  Paris. Hence, the public will perceive that the hopes of progressive
  improvement, which the proprietors of the Lady’s Book have expressed to their
  patrons, have been fully realized.
</p>
<p>
  A very material change is observable in the reading department of the Lady’s
  Book which improvement will proceed, to, at least, be sustained, by the
  exertions of its contributors; and, as a further expression of their gratitude
  to a patronizing community, the publication for January, 1834, will contain
  twenty-four additional pages, and the whole number will be exclusively devoted
  to and composed of ORIGINAL subjects—every article written expressly for the
  work.
</p>
<p>
  Among the contributors on this occasion may be enumerated Miss Leslie, author
  of the Prize Tale entitled “Mrs. Washington Potts”—Mrs. Hentz, author of the
  Prize Tragedy—the late Mrs. Gilbert—Joseph R. Chandler, Esq.—J.A. Shea, author
  of Adolph, Address to the Ocean, &amp;c.—the author of “A Tale of Fashionable
  Life”­—the author of “Sketches of a Jurist-Consult”—Y.P.—A.E.—and other
  well-known and popular writers, whose productions have given so peculiar a
  delight to the readers of the Lady’s Book. This publication has been always
  distinguished for its beautiful engravings of the Fashions, but it is the
  intention of the proprietors to render the one for January still more splendid
  than the previous ones. The public will perceive that, without heralding it by
  professions, a reference to past experience is the best promise of future
  exertions, which it shall be the publishers’ study to render both prompt and
  pleasing.

  In directing the attention of their readers to the improvements and exertions
  that have been increasingly made, to elevate the Lady’s Book to that station
  which it now occupies, the Proprietors have incurred a very considerable

  and it is confidently expected that the early transmission of arrears, will
  prove to them that their intentions and exertions have not been disregarded or
  forgotten, by those for whom they have been made.

  The work was originally undertaken as an experiment to ascertain how far the
  public would encourage a magazine exclusively devoted to one object, viz. the
  intellectual instruction and moral improvement of the rising generation. In
  order to render the work extensively useful, a large circulation was
  necessary, and to ensure this, a very low price was indispensable.
</p>
<p>
  Every effort has been made to combine all these points in the Magazine, and we
  are happy to say that the success of our experiment thus far, is very
  encouraging. The circulation at present is nearly 15,000; a number entirely
  beyond that of any similar work ever undertaken in this country. But great as
  it is, such are the accumulated expenses of the publication, from the number
  of engravings, and from the care attending it, together with the very low
  price at which it is afforded, that we need a still more extended circulation
  to enable us fully to develope [sic] our plan, and bring into activity all the
  means of rendering the work still more efficient and useful.

  The idea of a state of society in which there shall not be an individual,

  approached. But how is this to be done? By an union of heart and hand, among
  the good and wise, in giving the fullest possible activity and energy, to
  every instrument which leads to the desired end.

"		"Samuel Goodrich (1793-1860) was born in Ridgefield, Connecticut, the 6th of ten children and the son of a minister, in 1793. His career as a book publisher began in 1816. In the early 1820s Goodrich came to the conclusion that children as well as adults preferred to read truth rather than fancy and that it would be possible to present history, geography, science, etc. (truth) in such a way that it would be more interesting to children than fairies, giants and monsters. Based on this conclusion Goodrich moved his business to Boston and Peter Parley was born in 1827 with PETER PARLEY'S TALES ABOUT AMERICA. Goodrich expanded his publishing efforts to textbooks and magazines. His publications were so popular that he attracted imposters, particularly in England. Spurious Peter Parleys appeared everywhere, infuriating Goodrich, but he did not succeed in putting an end to them." from Contextual Notes at https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/digital/collection/childrens/id/460/rec/9	Samuel Goodrich (inferred)

Rankin's Letters	The Unionist	Advertisement with Abolitionist theme	"RANKIN’S LETTERS. Just published at the office of the Liberator, by request of
the Providence Anti-Slavery Society, a new edition of ‘Letters on Slavery,
addressed to Mr. Thomas Rankin, Merchant at Middlebrook, Augusta Co., Va.'—By
John Rankin, Pastor of the Presbyterian Churches of Ripley and Strait Creek,
Brown County, Ohio. Price $18 per hundred—25 cents single. Boston, Sept. 7,
1833.
"		Another important text that almost certainly found its way inside the Canterbury Female Academy. Its author, John Rankin, became one of the most fearless and successful conductors of self-liberated people fleeing enslavement, due to his location in Ohio just over the border from Kentucky. Rankin's <em>Letters</em> were admired by William Lloyd Garrison, and read by many Abolitionists in the 1830s.	John Rankin; Thomas Rankin

  We believe it will be acceptable to Christians generally, being free from

"	I should obtain my own copy of this picture - https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/61831880/charles-backus-storrs	"<p>
  The following communication from a christian, a philanthropist, and a
  gentleman, we insert with pleasure. The language is energetic, occasionally
  severe, but we hold not ourself answerable for its severity. The circumstances
  of the case justify it. Cruel charges, unsubstantiated by the least shadow of
  evidence, have been too frequently brought against Abolitionists, and we have
  a right to demand the proof or a retraction, and if neither is given, he who
  makes those charge is, to say the least, a traducer of character.
</p>
<p><em>For the Unionist.</em></p>
<p>To the Editor of the Norwich Courier</p>
<p>
  SIR—I presume that you will agree with me in the sentiment that the editor of
  a public journal is under weighty responsibilities, and should suffer nothing
  to appear in the columns of his publication but with extreme caution. Opinions
  disseminated through the columns of a newspaper will, to a greater or less
  degree, influence the opinions of the reading community, and when the editor
  of a paper advocates any particular doctrine, he doubtless desires that his
  readers may adhere to the same doctrine. Great care therefore is necessary
  that a person in your connexion with community should disseminate thro’ that
  community, precepts which shall bear the test of truth—principles founded upon
  the strictest rules of justice and sound morality. You sir, I presume,
  professing to be governed by high and honorable motives, will readily assent
  to this, and at all times be willing to turn your attention to any thing which
  may have escaped your pen, and if any one of your readers should be so
  unfortunate as to differ from you in sentiment, you will, I presume,
  cheerfully examine the ground of their complaints, to be convinced, or to show
  some reason for a different course.
</p>
<p>
  I would request of you, sir, to re-peruse an article which appeared under your
  editorial head, Oct. 23d, in relation to Miss Crandall’s school and the
  sentiments of the abolitionists. I would ask you to do it calmly and
  dispassionately—
  <em>searching for the truth</em>
  —unbiased by opinions previously expressed, farther than you find
  <em>reason</em>
  to be your supporter.
</p>
<p>
  You say, “Although we think that Miss Crandall has a right to continue her
  school we are by no means friendly to the doctrines which are said to be
  taught in it; yet these doctrines can never be put down by persecution—they
  must be met by fair argument, and in such a contest they will prove wholly
  untenable.” I am glad to find that you have never denied the
  <em>right</em>
  of Miss Crandall to teach such a school—it is rather a matter or surprise to
  me, as it probably is to you, that New-England should contain an enlightened
  man who
  <em>would</em>
  deny that right. I know not what doctrines you have heard to be taught in that
  school, neither have you seen fit to inform the public. But you have said that
  <em>dangerous</em>
  doctrines are taught there that ought to be “put down.” If so, are not you,
  sir, bound to tell us what these doctrines are, as you wish to enlighten the
  public all you can—to overthrow these dangerous doctrines, and to free society
  from their contamination, will you not condescend to meet them by “fair
  argument,” as “in such a contest” you are confident “they will prove wholly
  untenable?” I am anxious to see, what I have never yet seen and feat I never
  shal, the attempt made to “put them down” by “fair argument,” instead of
  addled eggs, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
  You say again, “The least that can be said of the Abolition scheme is that it
  is an
  <em>insane</em>
  project—one which no man in the full possession and exercise of his faculties
  can contemplate as being practicable, or at the present time desirable.” I
  know, sir, it is very easy for a person, especially when under a little
  excitement, to go on and make severe accusations against his opponents, but it
  is quite another thing to show the reason of these accusations. I might say
  that the editor of the Norwich Courier was governed by passion and prejudice,
  with as much ease as you charge Abolitionists of insanity; and I doubt not,
  sir, that I should be able to substantiate my charge as soon as you yours. I
  have seen similar charges in your paper before, but I have never known of your
  being more particular. You are satisfied with making a general assertion, why
  not specify wherein this insanity consists? The leading doctrine of the
  Abolitionists is that no man has a right to hold his fellow man in bondage a
  single moment. Is this insane? Is it untrue? Is it a fact that man
  <em>has a right</em>
  to rob his fellow man of liberty—of
  <em>himself?</em>
  If he
  <em>has</em>
  such a right, tell me, sir, who gave him that right, and how long it is to
  continue. If he has a
  <em>right</em>
  to hold him in bondage
  <em>one</em>
  moment, how many moments may he have that right? But who are these insane
  Abolitionists? How long since this spirit of insanity come upon them? They are
  all around you—men of distinguished worth—of brilliant talents—to whom you,
  sire, in your highest estimation of yourself, never considered yourself worthy
  to be called an equal. You accuse them of forwarding a project which is not
  desirable. Do you pronounce them all hypocrites? No, you dare not, but they
  are
  <em>insane,</em>
  and therefore may be, for aught you know, sincere. But they are men of
  exemplary piety—men of fervent prayer—of extensive influence in promoting the
  cause of our Redeemer. You have not been accustomed to pronounce them
  insane—even now you are ready to quote their opinions upon other subjects and
  would place more confidence in their judgment than in your own. How happens it
  that their insanity is confined to this subject alone?
</p>
<p>
  You say, “The agitators appear to have bid adieu to common sense and a regard
  for the constitution and the laws,” &amp;c. I know not what you call bidding
  adieu to common sense, but one thing I know, that the leading Abolitionists in
  our country are the leading men in every other project to benefit the human
  race—men distinguished for their moral courage, seeking for the approval of
  God rather than for the favor of man. They have inquired for the path of duty
  and having ascertained it they have not failed to run in that path. Some,
  perhaps, might say that common sense in this respect is a disposition to act
  in a manner most congenial with popular feeling, If this is your definition of
  the term, I admit that they have ‘bid adieu to common sense,’ but as I
  understand the term they have most strictly adhered to it.
</p>
<p>
  As for the charge of their disregarding the constitution and the laws, I think
  it a very grave accusation to be brought against many of the best men of our
  country. But you, sir, are not the only one who has seen fit to make
  it—neither are you the only one who has made it without specifying what part
  of the constitution or what laws they disregard—and I must tell you, sire,
  that neither you nor all the wholesale accusers who you join
  <em>can</em>
  point out a single line of our constitution from which Abolitionists, as such,
  have departed. “Bid adieu to a regard for the constitution!” It is not
  true—and I here call upon you, sir, to clear your character from the
  imputation of falsehood. I would not say, sir, that you
  <em>intended</em>
  to assert an untruth, but I
  <em>do</em>
  say that you
  <em>have</em>
  asserted one, and unless you retract or substantiate it, the charge of
  falsehood must rest upon you. Is it unconstitutional to assert that it is
  morally wrong to hold slaves? Does the constitution of a free, republican
  people forbid that we should
  <em>speak against</em>
  chaining the mortal body and degrading the immortal mind? Is it against the
  constitution of a Christian people to declaim against the cruel system of
  slavery? —to say that it is contrary to the righteous laws of God—that it is
  inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel and the precepts of our Savior? Is
  it a fact that the
  <em>republicans</em>
  of the United States hold one sixth of their number in the chains of the
  verist despotism—that
  <em>two millions</em>
  of our fellow creatures are groaning under worse than Egyptian servitude—that
  <em>two million</em>
  of immortal souls are shut out from the light of science and closed to the
  entrance of one cheering ray from the Sun of Righteousness—and that when a few
  fearless men stand forth and say that these things are
  <em>wrong,</em>
  you, the editor of a public journal, cry out that in so saying they have “bid
  adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Tell me, sir, if these things are
  facts? O that you could tell me that they were not facts! But, alas! they are.
  We must not say that it is
  <em>wrong</em>
  to degrade the image of God to a level with the brutes that perish, for it is
  unconstitutional. Thank God!&nbsp; we have no such constitution as this! Shame
  on my countrymen! Shame on any republican asserting such a doctrine! I know
  the constitution
  <em>permits</em>
  the several states to hold slaves if they choose—but no where does it say that
  we
  <em>shall not</em>
  raise our voices against this abominable system. Wherein, then, have
  Abolitionists “bid adieu to a regard for the constitution?” Will you, sir,
  point out this treason, or cease longer to make an unfounded accusation?
</p>
<p>
  You say, “That this unprincipled opposition to the labors of the Colonization
  Society will raise up many warm friends to the latter there is abundant ground
  to hope.” As “unprincipled,"" sir, as these ‘agitators’ may be, I deem it no
  disparagement to you to say that they are men in the splendor of whose moral
  qualities you would be hardly visible, and whose names will be breathed with
  veneration by the virtuous and the good when yours shall have long been
  forgotten. But I am perfectly willing that you should, if you can, console
  yourself that by this opposition many warm friends will be raised up to the
  Colonization Society, but perhaps it may soften future disappointment, to
  inform you that many of those who have been ""warm friends” to that society are
  flocking around the Abolition standard, and however many ‘warm friends’ the
  Colonization Society may have, the cause of Abolition must forever stand. As
  long as justice reigns in heaven and sin is found on earth, so long will those
  be found who will exert themselves to hasten the triumph of the former and
  crush and extirpate the latter, and as sure as God is good so sure will he
  cause them to prosper.
</p>
<p>
  Again you say, “If the blacks are to be benefitted at all, it can only be
  accomplished by the aid of the Colonization Society, and their removal to
  Africa.” O that you had spared the penning of that sentence! What principle do
  you mean to advocate? Into what would you convert our happy land? What, sir,
  shall we think of the man, professing to be governed by that religion which
  commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves, who tells us that here are two
  and a half millions of immortal beings among us, degraded and wretched, and if
  they “are to be benefitted at all” it must be by “their removal to Africa?”
  What, in the name of God, is the reason they cannot be benefitted here? What
  but that you and some of your brother editors are so wickedly prejudiced
  against them that you are determined they
  <em>shall not be?</em>
  They
  <em>can</em>
  be benefitted here—they
  <em>will</em>
  be benefitted here. The number of blacks in this country will never be less
  than at the present moment—for in the first place we have not the means to
  make them less, increasing as they do 70,000 per year, and in the second place
  if we had the means of carrying them to Africa they do not want to go. They
  must always remain with us unless we serve them as we have served the poor
  Indians, and though you may continue to assert that they must always remain
  degraded, yet every true Christian will rejoice that God in his good providence
  has ordered it otherwise.

Sixth Report of the American Temperance Society	The Unionist	Allied Reform Movements - Temperance	"<p align=""center"">
  SIXTH REPORT OF THE AMERICAN
  <strong>TEMPERANCE SOCIETY</strong>
  ,
</p>
<p align=""center""><em>Continued</em></p>
<p>
  IV. Laws which authorize the licensing of men to traffic in ardent spirit,
  violate the first principles of political economy, and are highly injurious to
  the wealth of a nation.
</p>
<p>
  The wealth of a nation consists of the wealth of all the individuals that
  compose it. The sources of wealth are labor, land, and capital. The last is
  indeed the product of the two former; but as it may be used to increase their
  value, it is considered by writers on political economy, as one of the
  original sources of national wealth. Whatever lessons either of these, or
  their productiveness when employed upon each other, lessens the wealth of the
  country. Capital may be employed in two ways; either to produce new capital,
  or merely to afford gratification, and in the production of that gratification
  he consumed, without repealing its value. The first may be called capital, and
  the last expenditure. These will of course bear inverse proportions to each
  other. If the first be large, the last must be small, and vice versa. Without
  any change of the amount of wealth, capital will be increased by the lessened
  by the increase of expenditure. Although the manner of dividing makes no
  difference with the present amount of national wealth, it makes great
  difference with the future amount; as it alters materially the sources of
  producing it, the means of an equal, or increased reproduction.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, a man fond of noise and excited agreeably by the hearing of it,
  pays a dollar for gunpowder, and touches fire to it. He occasions an entire
  loss of that amount of property. Although the powder maker and the merchant,
  may both have received their pay, if it has not benefitted the man, to him it
  has been a total loss; and if the sale of it was more profitable than would
  have been the sale of some useful article, it has been an entire loss to the
  community. And if by the explosion the man is burnt, partially loses his
  reason, is taken off a time from business, and confined by sickness to his
  bed, must have nurses, physicians, &amp;c. the loss is still increased. And if
  he never recovers fully his health, or reason, suffers his social affections
  and moral sensibility, becomes less faithful in the education of his children,
  and they are more exposed to temptation and ruin, and he is never again as
  able or willing to be habitually employed in productive labor, the nation
  loses equal to the amount of all these put together. And if his example leads
  other men to spend, and to suffer in the same way, the loss is still farther
  increased; and so on, through all its effects.
</p>
<p>
  And even though the powder maker and the merchant have made enormous profit,
  this does not prevent the loss to the community; any more than the profit of
  lottery gamblers, or counterfeiters of the public coin, prevents loss to the
  community. Nor does it meet the case, to say that the property changes hands.
  This is not true. The man who sold the powder made a profit of only a part
  even of the money which the other man paid for it; while he lost not only the
  whole, but vastly more. The whole of the original cost was only a small part
  of the loss to the buyer, and for the nation. The merchant gained nothing of
  the time, and other numerous expenses, which the buyer lost; nor does he in
  any way remunerate the community for that loss.
</p>
<p>
  Suppose that man, instead of buying the powder, had bought a pair of shoes;
  and that the tanner and the shoemaker had gained in this case, what the
  powder-maker and the merchant gained in the other; and that by the use of the
  shoes, though they were finally worn out, the man gained twice as much as he
  gave for them; without any loss of health, or reason, social affection, or
  moral susceptibility; and without any of the consequent evils.—Who cannot see
  that it would have increased his wealth, and that of the nation, without
  injury to any, and have promoted the benefit of all.
</p>
<p>
  This illustrates the principle with regard to ardent spirit. A man buys a
  quantity of it, and drinks it; when he would be, as the case with every man,
  in all respects better without it. It is to him an entire loss. The merchant
  may have made a profit of one quarter of the cost, but the buyer loses the
  whole; and he loses the time employed in obtaining and drinking it. He loses,
  also, and the community loses, equal to all its deteriorating effects upon his
  body and mind, his children, and all who come under his influence. His land
  becomes less productive. The capital of course produced by this land and labor
  is diminished; and thus the means are diminished of future reproduction. And
  by the increase of expenditure in proportion to the capital, it is still
  farther diminished, till to meet the increasingly disproportionate expenses,
  the whole is often taken, and the means of future reproduction are entirely
  exhausted. And if there is no seed to sow, there is of course no future
  harvest. This is but a simple history of what is taking in thousands of cases
  continually; and of what is the tendency of the traffic in ardent spirit from
  beginning to end. It lessens the productiveness of land and labor, and of
  course diminishes the amount of capital; while in proportion, it increases the
  expenditure, and thus in both ways is constantly exhausting the means of
  future production. And this is its tendency, in all its bearing, in proportion
  to the quantity used, from the man who takes only his glass, to the man who
  takes his quart a day. It is a palpable and gross violation of all correct
  principles of political economy; and from beginning to end, tends to diminish
  all the sources of national wealth.

"	Might we be sensing William's influence here? The word “diminish” is twice spelled “dimish” in this last paragraph. I corrected that in this transcription. 	This is a continuation from previous editions of the paper. Because I cannot tell what <em>The Unionist</em> would have excerpted, I have not included any more of it at this time. This particular excerpt buttresses my published contention that the students at the Canterbury Female Academy were reading advanced philosophy. While I disagree with the political economic analysis forwarded here, it is sophisticated for its time. The meeting of the American Temperance Society was held in May 1833, and the publication came out of Boston. This particular excerpt begins on p. 46 of the pamphlet, near the bottom of the page, through p. 48, most of the way down the page.

<p align=""center"">A NEW AND IMPORTANT SUGGESTION.</p>
<p align=""center"">CHRISTIAN SLAVERY.</p>
<p align=""center"">Another Reformation in the Church must be attempted.</p>
<p align=""center"">
  “Attempt great things—expect great things.” (The voice of the departed. [sic
  no close parentheses]
</p>
<p>
  IN consequence of the light poured on the public, and the church, by the
  spirited exertions of philanthropic individuals, a great change, in relation
  to intoxicating liquors, has been produced. The eye, heart, and hand of
  christian faith looks, prays, and acts for its completion.
</p>
<p>
  But another reformation is needed in the church. It must be as separate from
  slavery, as from intemperance. The nation groans under the burden and misery
  and guilt of both these sins. It is the solemn duty of the church to clear
  itself from both these tremendous crimes. This is not addressed to the world,
  for the world legalizes the traffic in rum, and in the bodies and souls of
  men. But it is addressed to the children of God, who, if they know and do
  their duty, can have no possible connection with either of these trades. If
  increasing light has shown that christians ought not to buy and sell ardent
  spirits, much more it is believed, will increasing light show that christians
  ought not to buy human beings.
</p>
<p>
  The Rev John Newton, even after he became pious, transported Africans in
  chains across the Atlantic, to be sold with their posterity into slavery.
  Could he have been a true christian, and have no upbraidings of conscience
  while so engaged? Yes. How is it possible? It was legal, and, at that time,
  honorable, and his mind was not enlightened.—Afterwards when it was he
  lamented his error. So there are in our country those who buy and sell their
  fellow beings, who, if their minds were enlightened, would lament and
  relinquish it.
</p>
<p>
  A few years ago, a man, whose whole daily earnings were required by his
  family, set up forty nights to run a distillery for forty dollars, which he
  gave to build a house of worship.—How could he think that money obtained by
  changing the bread of the poor, into the liquid fire of death, acceptable to
  God? Because his mind was in darkness. Would he do it now? No. Neither would
  the church now receive it. Why? Because the light of the temperance
  reformation has burst forth.
</p>
<p>
  Christians! who have promised supreme obedience to Him, that tasted death for
  every man,: and more for the rich man, who, in a superb dress, rides in a
  superb carriage, to a superb church, to worship in superb style, than for the
  poor African, who pulls cotton in the “fields of Alabama, and naked as in the
  hour of birth, trembles under the blasts of mid winter”—on you is this call
  for a reformation in the church of that God, who declares himself no respector
  [sic] of persons.—Why do you exclude the dealer in ardent spirits from the
  communion table, and invite to it the dealer in human flesh? This could not,
  would not be, if there had been half so much effort made to show the utter
  abominations of christian slavery, as there has been to show the abominations
  of christian drunkenness. Whatever maybe the event of slavery and intemperance
  in the world a sufficiency of light will show, and cause to be removed
  these shocking deformities of the christian church. One denomination has
  already raised thousands of dollars to assist their brethren in becoming free
  from the deep stains of this awful sin. When will other denominations be
  equally sincere and active to cleanse themselves from this pollution? The
  answer is plain. When they are as conscientious and as much enlightened.
</p>
<p>
  To have light poured on this subject as its importance demands, it is proposed
  to raise fifty dollars, as a premium for the best essay on this deeply
  interesting subject. When the church is pure, we may then expect the smiles
  and approbation of heaven on our now almost divided land. And oh! May none
  refuse their mite to reward the close application of time and talents to this
  most vitally important theme; for it is believed the temperance reformation
  commenced in this way.
</p>
<p>
  Donations will be received by the Editors of the Genius of Temperance, and the
  Editor of the Emancipator, 126, Nassau street. A part of the money has already
  been raised by a few ladies in Massachusetts. It is hoped that others, who are
  opposed to slavery in the church of Christ, will speedily forward enough to
  make it up to $50, when the sum will be given to him who shall show most
  conclusively to the christian church and to christian ministers, their duty to
  “Break every yoke.” The essays which shall be written for the prize, are to be

"		<em>The People's Magazine</em> was a family-oriented bi-weekly magazine that featured stories of distant, exotic, and interesting places, animals, and people. It was especially prized for its engravings. It began publication in 1833. Unlike many of the periodicals that advertised in <em>The Unionist</em>, it took no political or philosophic positions, even implicitly, on slavery.

  My dear old friend, I wish you would give notice to all the folks, from
  Madawaska clear to South Carolina, nullifiers and all, that I’ve got my book
  done at last, and it’s ready for ‘em at Lilly, Wait, Colman &amp; Holden’s
  Bookstore, 121, Washington street, Boston. You may tell ‘em I come clear on
  from Washington, purpose to ‘t was done well; and you may tell ‘em too, if you
  are a mind to, that you come up from Portland to help about it. And I guess
  when they find that we put our heads together about it, they wont [sic] be
  afraid but what it’s done right. I got some of the best picter [sic] makers
  there is in Boston to make some picters [sic] for it. And they’ve put in a
  picter of me, and one of General Jackson, and a few more of us, and some queer
  notions besides. On the whole I think it’s about the prettiest book I;ve seen
  this many a day. It beats President Jackson’s and Mr. Clay’s all hollow. They
  showed me a cute pretty book, that they called the Token, they said was about
  the prettiest thing in the book way they had in Boston, and I don’t know but
  the kiver is rather prettier than mine, but as for the picters and the
  reading, I say give me mine for all that.

<p>So I remain your loving friend,</p>
